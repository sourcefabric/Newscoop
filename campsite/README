INTRODUCTION

CAMPSITE is a content management system with multi-lingual Unicode support,
designed for medium to large sized online publications. Issues, back archives,
as well as subscription management are fully implemented features. At the core
of management system sits the CAMPFIRE, a Java program supporting Unicode fonts,
allowing contributors and editors to control layout online in their native font
face. Style features can be assigned via buttons - similar to editors such as
Wordpad - meaning no HTML knowledge is necessary for formatting text.

We encourage further development of this software and would like to make any
progress accessible to all other users. Please contact us if you have or intend
to developed this software further.
