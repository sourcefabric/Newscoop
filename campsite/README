INTRODUCTION

CAMPSITE is a content management system with multi-lingual
Unicode support, designed for medium to large sized online
publications. Issues, back archives, as well as subscription
management are fully implemented features. At the core of
management system sits the CAMPFIRE, a Java program supporting
Unicode fonts, allowing contributors and editors to control
layout online in their native font face. Style features can be
assigned via buttons - similar to editors such as Wordpad -
meaning no HTML knowledge is necessary for formatting text.

We encourage further development of this software and would
like to make any progress accessible to all other users.
Please contact us if you have or intend to developed this
software further.

CAMPSITE offers...
-  support of managing article translations in different
   languages
-  advanced editorial interface for remote article editing
-  cut and paste formatting from other editors into the online
-  Java Editor for HTML with near WYSIWYG feel (CAMPFIRE)
-  its own customizable search-engine
-  built-in subscription system
-  management of dictionaries

CREDITS

The original CAMPSITE concept was developed by C@MP in
collaboration with Transitions Online, who started using
CAMPSITE in late 2000. Coding and further development was
accomplished by DNT and Recognos.

TECH-SPECS

Implementing CAMPSITE for your purposes requires the following
technical set-up, nothing out of the ordinary.

CAMPSITE server:
- runs on a Linux server, tested with RedHat 7.0 and Mandrake 8.0
- needs an Apache web to be running, and its virtual servers
  configured by the administrator.
- for data storage it is needed a MySQL database server for
  Linux. The tests were made on MySQL v.3.23.36.

CAMPSITE client:
- tested on Netscape under Unix, Macintosh and Windows,
  Internet Explorer under Windows.
- has a client Editor interface implemented as a Java Applet
  (browser-compatibility reason).
- copy the file swingall.jar in the Java classes directory
  (see http://www.campware.org).
- unpack the file unicoded.zip in the same Java classes
  directory (see http://www.campware.org).

Note: Client site preparation will be made redundant with the
evolution of browsers, since this module becomes native in
built-in Java Virtual Machines. The file is distributed freely
and native with the JDK 1.2 package.

WORKING DEMO

CAMPSITE in action can be seen at the Transitions Online
website (http://www.tol.cz). However, there is a version
implemented at campware for testing purposes. Contact us for
