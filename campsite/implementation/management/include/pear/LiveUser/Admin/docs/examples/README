How to setup the database examples

For every example found in this directory you need to create a database
and insert the relevant schema dumps called demodata.xml from the example directory.

The demodata.php script in the examples directory of the client documentation
explains how to install these schema files.
You can call the demodata.php script without parameters from the web or from the shell
to learn how it works.
