INTRODUCTION

CAMPSITE is a content management system with multilingual Unicode support, designed for medium-to-large-size online news publications. Issues, copy flow, back archives, as well as subscription management are fully implemented features. At the core of CAMPSITE is CAMPFIRE, the Java Editor supporting Unicode, which allows contributors and editors to publish content and control layout online in their native alphabets. Formatting can be altered in a similar way as in editors such as Wordpad, meaning that no HTML knowledge is necessary for formatting text.

The original CAMPSITE concept was developed by Center for Advanced Media-Prague (C@MP) in collaboration with Transitions Online, which started using CAMPSITE in late 2000. DNT-Cluj (http://www.dntcj.ro) and Recognos (http://www.recognos.com), software companies based in Cluj, Romania accomplished original coding and part of the further development. For a detailed revision history, click here. CAMPSITE in action can be seen at the Transitions Online web site (http://www.tol.cz).

You can test drive CAMPSITE at the campware project site (http://www.campware.org) and take a look at its features. Mail us for a login (contact@campware.org).

CAMPSITE tech specs in a nutshell:

CAMPSITE server:
 runs on a Linux server, originally tested on RedHat 7.0 release, and has proven compatible with Mandrake 8.0.
 requires an Apache web server to be running, and its virtual servers configured by the administrator.
 needs a MySQL database server for Linux to be able to store data. The tests were made on MySQL v.3.23.36.

CAMPSITE client side:
 runs on Netscape under Unix, Windows (versions up to 4.7), and Macintosh (see known limitations for the Mac), and Internet Explorer under Windows.
 requires local installation of customized Java-class packages (At the moment of the publishing of this manual, an installer is available for Windows 98, Me, and 2000).
1. INSTALLATION GUIDE

1.1. Requirements
The server part of the application runs on a Linux computer. It was originally developed and tested on RedHat 7.0 release, and it has proven compatible with Mandrake 8.0.
Before installing CAMPSITE, make sure you have two other applications up and running:
1. Apache web server - your http daemon, serving your web site to the world
	http://www.apache.org

	For installation instructions, see the Apache web site. Installing Apache will generate the httpd.conf file referred to further down. This file contains all relevant information for Apache to handle the content on your Linux server. The adjustments described below need to be made in order to tell Apache about the procedures for CAMPSITE files and templates.

2. MySQL Database Server - this application handles the CAMPSITE database. The tests were made on MySQL v.3.23.36
	http://www.mysql.com

Three components of MySQL are needed for CAMPSITE:
a) the server for i386 systems,
b) client programs for i386 systems and
c) files and libraries for development for i386 systems.
All of those can be found on the MySQL website.

When installing on Red Hat, try to find the section 'Standard Binary RPMs' which have been compiled especially for Red Hat and should cause the least hassle. You can install these filed on prompt level by typing 'rpm -t nameoffile.rpm' (without the '').

1.2. TODO

Here is what you need to do.

1.2.1 Configure the Web server
First you need to change the behavior of the http daemon (the Web server). The configuration file, called httpd.conf, is normally found in the /etc/httpd/conf/ folder (N.B. non-standard installation of the Apache server can change the location of the file). The changes you have to apply to the file are:

- activate the DirectoryIndex directive and add to it the following options:
DirectoryIndex index.xql /priv/templates/idx.xql
- activate the IndexIgnore directive and set it to
IndexIgnore *
add the following lines:
AddHandler www-sql .xql
Action www-sql /cgi-bin/www-sql
AddHandler parser .tpl
Action parser /cgi-bin/tpl_cgi

- make sure that the server has the rights to read, write and execute in the folder where the file are stored and uploaded. Standardly, the user and group should be set as 'httpd'; the rights should be set as 'rwx' for the user and 'rw' for the group. Consult the Linux Administration Guide for further information. Furthermore, the Web server should have activated the UniqueID option (the mod_unique_id should be loaded)

restart the httpd daemon
killall httpd
{PATH}/httpd
(or /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart)

- a public free CGI we used 'www-sql', must be configured to allow the 'exec' directive activated and to allow recursivity. The package we supply is well configured, but if you want to install a newer version of www-sql later (for further development and other purposes) make sure to compile it with these options.

1.2.2 Customize the application framework
Copy the CAMPSITE archive in a directory on the server.
Unarchive it using the command: tar xzvf <campsite_archive>.
Enter campsite directory.
Run './install', answer the install questions and wait for the application to be installed.

1.2.3 The CAMPFIRE Java Editor
At the heart of CAMPSITE's client interface, lies CAMPFIRE, a text editor implemented as a Java Applet. To enable this applet to work, you must copy install certain (still) non-standard Java classes on your local workstation(s).

The files you need to install locally are swingall.jar and unicoded.zip, both of which you should have created when you unpacked the campsite archive (campsite-2.x.x.tar.gz). Both of these files should be unpacked in the folders where Java classes are regularly stored. The breakdown according to browser/operating system is as follows:

a) Netscape under Unix:
/usr/lib/netscape/java/classes
b) Internet Explorer under Mac OS 9.x:
see Known Limitations: Apple Macintosh below
c) Netscape under Windows (up to version 4.7):
/Program Files/Netscape/Communicator/java/classes
N.B. swingall.jar should not be unpacked, just drop it in the above folder
d) Internet Explorer under Windows (all versions):
/Windows/java/classes
N.B. An installer is currently available for Windows 98, Me, and 2000 (Not NT!!)

TECH NOTE: The need to install Swing on workstations will disappear with the evolution of browsers, which will have this module native in their built-in Java Virtual Machines. The file is distributed freely and is native with the JDK 1.2 package.

1.2.4 KNOWN LIMITATIONS: Apple Macintosh
Due to the limitations related to the length of file names under Mac OS (up to 9.x), the Java virtual machine doesn't act as it should (Java compiler generates long names for the so-called inner classes). Our tests have proven that the original installation kit for Swing, provided by Sun Microsystems and Apple doesn't install properly the libraries, while the .jar file format is not recognized by the Java Virtual Machine (called MRJ under Mac OS). Human interaction is required as follows:

1) install the MRJ file (version MRJ 2.2 is available at the time of publishing of this document; the latest version can be found at: http://developer.apple.com/java/download.html);
2) install the Swing packet (Swing version 1.1.8 is currently available, but the latest version can be found at http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/download.html);
3) move the swingall.jar (which has been created by the Swing installation kit in step 2) to a PC computer and unpack it there, then re-pack it with a .zip extension (instead of .jar) an copy it back on the Mac. This will allow Swing-based applets to be run under Internet Explorer for Mac. The problem of loading classes from the local file system has not been solved yet, so the multilingual support feature does not work on the Mac. Hopefully System X should bring good news in this respect.

1.2.5 KNOWN LIMITATIONS: MS Windows/Netscape
CAMPFIRE v. 1.0.0 works in Netscape versions up to 4.7. Although Netscape 6 (Gecko) has native support for Swing, its makers have diverged from the original Sun Microsystems specification, so they are not compatible with CAMPFIRE. The simple installer provided for Windows (98, Me, and 2000), will thus not install the Swing classes for Netscape if version 6 is detected on the workstation. What's more, pre-Gecko versions do not support normal cut and paste (ctrl-C and ctrl-V) features for Java, so you have to use the special clipboard button on the browser in order to emulate this functionality.

In short, if you are working under Windows and want to run CAMPFIRE with the least hassle, our advice is to stick to Internet Explorer. Not only is the cutting and pasting easier, but the applet runs faster, as it is able to use decompressed swing classes (instead of the swing.jar archive that Netscape accesses to run CAMPFIRE).

1.2.6 HOWTO
The system's default administrator authentication is: admin:admn00. The interface of the application can be found at the address:
http://<servername>/priv/

The publication can be seen at the address name configured in the application:
http://<publication site name>

The parser runs automatically.
 
PART II: PUBLISHING ONLINE WITH CAMPSITE

2. BRINGING YOUR PUBLICATIONS ONLINE WITH CAMPSITE

CAMPSITE enables you to publish (host) multiple multilingual publications (web sites) on the same server. The process can be roughly divided in four steps:
 configuring the publishing environment (establishing access rights, country-relevant information, languages you intend to publish in, subscription, etc.)
 establishing the structure of your publications
 creating the templates which determine the look and feel of your publications
 adding content and managing your publications

2.1. Configuring the publishing environment
Your first step on the road to bringing your publications online with CAMPSITE is to configure the publishing environment. This involves setting up parameters such as languages that you are or will be publishing in, definition of typical user types, and the very structure of your publication(s). 

After you log in for the first time with the default user name (admin) and password (admn00) you will reach administrator's interface 

The left frame contains a list of modules that you can access, while the right frame displays the currently selected module. 

CAMPSITE appears differently to different users. Each user sees only the options that he or she has the right to access or alter. A typical back-end user (an editor or journalist) will get to see only a fraction of the options available to a fully authorized user (such as the default administrator).

2.1.1 Languages
While CAMPSITE's default language is English, you are by no means limited to publishing in that language only. It's actually very much au contraire.

The language module enables you to configure support for languages that you wish to publish in. If your tongues of choice happen to be absent from the list of CAMPSITE's pre-configured languages, you can configure your own languages.

To do so, enter the Languages module and click on Add new language. You should enter the language name (both in English and in the language itself), its code (e.g. HR for Croatian), the code page you wish to use for that language (e.g. ISO-8859-4 for Baltic character sets), and the names of months and days of the week. 

For an extensive description of languages and code pages, see Appendix II.

2.1.2 Countries
This module determines how country lists will appear in user-profile forms. The module allows you to create country lists in different languages. 

When you click on Add new country, you will be prompted to enter the country's name in a language of your choice as well as the country's code. The language dropdown menu will contain as many languages as you have defined in the Languages module (see section 2.1.1). 

N.B. The language you are asked to specify is the language in which you are entering a country's name, *NOT* the language spoken in the country!

2.1.3 User Management
CAMPSITE's user management module allows you to control access to the backend and the front end of your publication(s). In other words, the module, which features a search option, allows you to define who will have the right to manage and edit content on your sight and who will be allowed to read it.

2.1.3.1 Backend Access: Creating User Types
A user is generally defined by the list of the tasks he or she has and is allowed to do in a system. In CAMPSITE, this list of tasks ranges from creating, managing, and editing publications, sections, and articles, to template management and definition of the publishing environment. 

To simplify user management, CAMPSITE allows you to create generic user types, which can then be assigned to multiple users, instead of taking care of every single access right for every single user. 

CAMPSITE comes "out of the box" with three default user types:
 Administrator - user with full authorization, i.e. all rights (normally reserved to webmasters)
 Editor - standard backend user with rights limited to basic article management and editing (normally assigned to journalists and editors)
 Reader - the profile limited to viewing the site, i.e. front end only. 

User-management module operations are straightforward: 

To create your custom user profiles, click on User types and then on Add new user type. To add a user, click on Users and choose Add new user account. 

You should specify the full name of the user, user name, password, and choose a predefined user type (i.e. one of the default types or your custom user types). If you would like to further fine tune the rights assigned to a particular user, go to Users and click on Rights in the same line with the user's name. 

2.1.3.2 Front-End Access: Subscription 
CAMPSITE allows you to control public access to your publication(s) through its built-in subscription module, about whose configuration you can read more in section 2.4)

For now, you should know that all articles you create in your CAMPSITE publication(s) are by default available to subscribers only. Publication editors or administrators have the right to make an article accessible to non-subscribers. 

The way it works from readers' side is as follows:

If a reader tries to access a non-public article, she is informed that she is not allowed to read the article but is provided with an option to subscribe immediately to that article or other articles or the whole publication. A temporary 7-day subscription is activated immediately. During this period, the reader has a chance to effect the payment and consequently have her subscription extended by the administrator. 

The publication's administrator is automatically notified of all new subscriptions by e-mail. Subscribers also receive automatically generated e-mail reminders that their subscription is expiring four days before the event. 

2.2. Creating publications
CAMPSITE has a clear four-tier hierarchical structure, which conforms to the traditional structure of news publications. Each publication is thus made up of issues; each issue is in turn made up of sections, which are themselves comprised of articles. 

CAMPSITE's user interface is straightforward. A site map is present on every screen, which enables easy navigation from one level to another.

Each module of the publication is associated to a level. By clicking on the name of the module, you enter the structure of the next level or you edit the current module, depending on its position.

For example, after creating the "Prague Times" publication, by clicking on 'Prague Times' in the list of publications, you enter the list of issues for "Prague Times". By clicking the name of an issue, you enter its list of sections. By clicking the name of a section you enter the article list. By clicking the article name you enter the article structure and can edit the different components (fields) of the article.

2.2.1 Creating a new publication
To create a new publication, you need to enter the Publications module. Once you are there, click on Add new publication. 

NOTE 1: If you are not the default administrator, you may not be able to see the Add new publication option. You may want to ask your site administrator to alter your access rights. Bear in mind, however, that a good administrator would be reluctant to hand over those rights to more than a handful of people. If you are not among those select few, your Publications view will only contain a list of publications hosted on this particular CAMPSITE server.

At this point, you should specify the following:
- Name of the publication (e.g. "Prague Times")
- Site - the name of the server (or IP address) on which your publication will be hosted (e.g. www.praguetimes.net) and on which it will ultimately accessible to readers.
- Language - the default language of the publication
- Pay time - the period within which readers have to pay for their subscription, i.e. the length of free trial subscription. (See section 2.4 for more details.)

Any of those parameters can be altered or fine-tuned at a later stage.

NOTE 2: CAMPSITE allows multiple publications to be hosted on the same server (computer), but to make different publications directly accessible to readers, you need to specify different virtual web servers. For example, if you want to add another publication (e.g. "Moldovan Contemporary Political Thought") onto the server on which you are hosting your "Prague Times" publication, you need to assign it a different virtual web server name (e.g. www.moldovanthought.com)

If you have vhosts set up in your Apache configuration, you can start a new publication and specify the URL for this vhost, which will then allow the users to access your publication through that address.

2.2.2 Creating a new issue
Once you have successfully created your first publication, click on its name (e.g. "Prague Times"). This will lead you to the Add new issue option, on which you should duly click to proceed with the creation of the structure of your publication. 

The options you will be presented with are Create a new structure and Use the structure of the previous issue. If you are creating a new publication from the ground up, the first option one is your only real choice. 

The second option will be the one to choose once you are ready to publish additional issues of your publication, because it allows you to automatically create a new issue with the same logical structure (sections) as the preceding one. Sections are created but are empty, so that you can begin to add articles immediately. You should possibly only change the name of the new issue, because it will otherwise remain the same as the last issue. The templates, however, are not copied, so the new issue must be linked to a template for the front page (see Note 3 for more details). 

You can introduce changes to the structure of the issue you just created, including adding or deleting sections or adding new article types, changing field lists within article types, etc.

NOTE 3: If you are copying the structure of an old issue, you need to connect the new issue to a front-page template (see Section 3 of this manual). If you are not bent on changing the look of your publication, just select the old template; If you wish to alter the visual layout of your publication, you should select a new template that you have meanwhile created. Regardless of your choice, old issues will keep their original layout (unless you go back and change their template associations manually for each of them).


Whichever option you choose, be it to replicate the structure of the last issue or create a brand new structure, you will be able to change the name, the default language and the number of the issue. 


TIP: While you can always go back and change the name and the default language of an issue at any time, the issue number cannot be changed once it is specified. If you are planning to add older issues of your newspaper/static-HTML site at a later stage to the same CAMPSITE publication, you may consider continuing the series. For example, if you just published issue 154 of Prague Times in static HTML before moving to CAMPSITE, you could assign number 155 to the first issue you are creating within CAMPSITE.

2.2.3 Add new sections to an issue
Entering the Sections view for an Issue, you can add new sections to the current issue by clicking on Add new section. You should specify the name and section number (within the issue). While you can come back later and change the name of the section, the section number can be chosen only at the time when the new section is added.

2.2.4 Defining article types
The next step in setting up your publication is to define the types of articles that you intend to publish on your site. What you are actually doing at this stage is specifying the way articles will appear to the person who will be adding content to your publications. For example, a feature story is likely to have more components than a brief news item. 

To create an article type, click on Article types and then select Add new article type. First, you should pick a name for your article type (N.B. only letters are allowed, no spaces or special characters). Then you can start adding fields to the article type by clicking on 'New field' option (or proceed to add other article types by choosing 'Add another'). You will be requested to specify the name of the field (e.g. Author, Date, Deck, Body, AuthorBiography -- remember no spaces or special characters are allowed!). 

TIP: Try to give intuitive names to your article types and fields within them, because chances are that you will not be the only person doing the publishing. For example, if you have an article type that you would like to use in your sports section, call it Sportsarticle, not Sp or Artic or anything equally cryptic. It will save you time and nerves when journalists and admin staff start doing all of the posting (and all of the consequent asking). Similarly, when creating an article type, try to make the sequence of fields logical, i.e. close to the way they will appear to the readers on the site (e.g. Author - Date -Deck - Articlebody - Bibliography). At this stage of development, CAMPSITE does not allow reordering of fields within article types.


After you name the field, you have to specify its type. There are three options:

 Text - this type of field can contain a maximum of 265 characters. It does not support HTML tags and it its appearance/formatting/character set is entirely determined by the template (see section 3 for more information on templates).
 Date - this is a standard date field with a fixed syntax of YYYY-MM-DD
 Body - this type of field can be up to 64KB in size (database space is, however, used optimally, as the database server adjusts the size on the disk to be sure the field fits, so there is no waste of space). More important, this type of field is edited with CAMPSITE's near-WYSIWYG Java editor -- CAMPFIRE. CAMPFIRE enables you to enter text in any character set or alphabet, and even in multiple alphabets. Text entered through CAMPFIRE is independent of the format and character set specified by the template. Moreover, CAMPFIRE allows you to insert images, links, and formatting tags, as well as special CAMPSITE Dictionary tags.

After you have specified the field type, you can keep on adding fields to the article type or finish the operation. Anytime later you can add more fields to the article type without affecting the rest of the application or the database contents. You will not lose articles if you add fields to their particular article type. 

WARNING: While you can safely add article fields to a article types, deleting them may cause improper functioning of templates that refer to these fields. Article-type management is best left exclusively to expert users (e.g. administrators)


2.2.5 Creating articles within a section
Once you are in the Articles view within a section (you get there by clicking on a section name), you can create new articles by selecting the Add new article option. (This is a recursive option that allows you to add any given number of articles to the current section.) 

Once you are in the Add new article view, you will see a dialog box with the following fields/options:

 Name: This field is mandatory, because it determines how your article will be known to the database and appear in the Articles view. You, however, have the liberty of renaming the article at any time.
 Type: you have to select one of the available article types from the dropdown menu. The choice you make at this stage cannot be altered later.
 Language: select the language in which you want to create your article from the dropdown menu. The list of languages will contain the languages you have defined in the Languages module (see section 2.1.1). The language choice you make at this stage is final, though you can always create a version in another language with the Translate option in the Articles view.
 Show article on front page: Tick this box if you would like the article to be displayed on your publication's front (home) page. You can alter this choice at any time.
 Show article on section page: Tick this box if you would like the article to be displayed on the main (home) page (a section "homepage") of the section within you have created the article. You can alter this choice at any time.
 Keywords: Specify the words that will help search engines find your article more easily. This field is optional and you can alter it at any stage. 
After you fill out the required fields and make your article-display choices, you should press the 'Save changes' button. You will have the option to either edit the article you just created (press YES) or go back to the Articles view (press NO). 

TIP: You may write the article name in any alphabet, but bear in mind that if you are publishing a multilingual publication that includes two non-Western European (i.e. that use code pages different than ISO-8859-1) alphabets, say Hebrew and Russian, you will not be able to display article names in both languages correctly at the same time in the article view. This is because article name is a text-type field and it is affected by the encoding that is currently active in your browser. Therefore you may want to create a separate field for the actual title of the article while filling the name fields with characters that belong to code pages that can be correctly displayed together in the article list (e.g. ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-2, or ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-5; in both cases you should select the respective non-Western European encoding in your browser for viewing article lists.


TECH NOTE: Name is the default field available for any article, no matter what type of article is selected. This was created both for testing purposes and for letting the webmaster define a default behavior of articles. For example, if a template doesn't provide a handler for a specific article type, or you don't know the list of fields of an article type, you can be sure that there is a field called 'name'!



2.2.6 Editing articles: Edit Article Details view
If you choose to edit your newly created article right away you will be led to the Edit Article Details view. This is the main article-editing interface, to which you will also get when you click on a name of any article in the Articles view. This view shows how the article is stored in the database. Its look will depend on the article type you have assigned to that article when you created it. 

The fields you will see regardless of the type of article you are viewing are:
 Name, containing the name you had given to the article when you created it. This field is editable.
 Type, informs you which article type you had chosen for your article. You cannot alter this field 
 Uploaded, showing the date the article was edited for the first time. You cannot change this field.
 Keywords, where you can add or delete the words that describe your article better to search engines. 

You will also see the two check boxes you saw when you created the article (Show article on front page and Show article on section page, respectively), plus another option: Allow users without subscriptions to view the article. You should tick the latter if you want to make your article visible to viewers who have not subscribed to your publication (see section 2.2.4).

In addition to these system-determined fields and options, you may see any number and combination of different fields that you had made when you created a given article type.

As it was mentioned earlier in this manual (see section 2.2.4), there are three types of fields: Text, Date, and Body. 

Usually there are several text-type fields, designed to contain shorter bits of text, such as article titles, short descriptions, author names, etc. There are rarely more than one date-type fields, which web designers normally use to provide the journalists with an option to specify the date the article was published (posted). 

Both text- and date-type fields can be edited directly in the Edit Article Details view.

WARNING: Whenever you edit text- and date-type fields, you have to press the Submit changes button located at the bottom of the page before leaving the Edit Article Details view. Moreover, date-type fields have a fixed syntax of YYYY-MM-DD. If you enter data in any other way, you may get incorrect results

Body-type fields usually contain the bulk of an article's content (the main narrative part of the text, bibliographies, author biographies etc.). To edit them, you have to launch CAMPFIRE, CAMPSITE's Java editor. You can do so by clicking on the 'Edit' button near the left corner of each body-type field. You can edit one body-type field at a time.

Above the article structure, you will always see the following six buttons:
 Submit/Publish/Unpublish (depending on the copy-flow status of your article)
 Images - lets you upload images that can be used within body-type fields of the article. 
 Unlock, which you can use to withdraw your reservation of the article (e.g. when you are finished with your editing). The unlocking is in principle done automatically, but since CAMPSITE is a server-based application accessed through web browsers, a number of events (computer crashes, line falling, etc.) could prevent this from happening. 
 Preview, which allows you to preview the article (see below for more detail
 Translate, which allows you to create a version of the article you are editing in another language. 
 Delete, which is self-explanatory

2.2.7 Editing body-type fields: Working with CAMPFIRE
CAMPFIRE allows contributors (journalists or editors) without any technical or HTML knowledge to perform extensive formatting procedures. 

Chances are that anyone who has ever worked with a text editor should find CAMPFIRE intuitive to use. CAMPFIRE features a toolbar with buttons from which main functions can be performed, while additional features can be accessed from pull-down menus. 

All text-formatting features are fully WYSIWYG, except align justify. The non-WYSIWYG features are insertion of images, links, subheads/page breaks and CAMPSITE Dictionary keywords. 

From left to right on the toolbar, in order of appearance, the buttons are:
 New - clears the editor; 
 Select all;
 Undo, which allows you to undo multiple changes in the order you made them;
 Redo, which does exactly the opposite; 
 Clipboard operations, which opens an extra window displaying the content of the clipboard and its standard functionality (this feature was mainly implemented to provide cut and paste functions to Netscape users; see section 1.2.5);
 Italic
 Bold 
 Underline
 Align left
 Align center
 Align right
 Choose font color
 Clear attributes, which will remove all formatting from the selected area. 
 Insert keyword, will mark the selected word as Dictionary keyword (for more on Dictionary and keywords, see section 2.3 of this manual). 
 Insert subhead allows subheads in your text to become page breaks. This command inserts a code around the subhead you select, which the parser will interpret as a page break and parse the subhead on a new page (N.B. This feature has to be enabled in your templates; see Part 3 of this manual for more details). 
 Insert image inserts an image placeholder into the text. When you click on it, you are prompted to select one of the images you previously uploaded for that particular article. You can also specify the alignment and alt text (the text that shows up when you go over an image with a mouse within a browser).
 External link allows you to create an absolute link in the text. You do so by highlighting (selecting) the segment of the text that you would like to link to a web page (URL) of your choice and clicking on the External link button. This places green link markers on both sides of your selection; when you click on either of them, you are prompted to provide the URL and you can specify where you want the link to open (e.g. a new window).
 Internal link allows you to create links to other articles that you have already created within campsite. The actual procedure is analogous to the one with external links.
 Save/Upload does exactly that: it saves the changes by uploading the file into the CAMPSITE database. If you close the window without saving, you run the chance of losing your data (CAMPSITE will prompt you to save them before you leave the window, but the best policy is to save your edits regularly).

All of these functions are also available from the dropdown menus. The menus feature three important extra options:
 Font size, which is self-explanatory 
 Insert keyword, which allows you to mark a word as a Dictionary keyword (see section 2.3)
 Justify all (checkbox in the Other Options dropdown menu) - when you check this box, the entire text within the editor becomes justified (see NOTE 4 for more information). Unlike other kinds of alignment, this one does not conform to the WYSIWYG standard and can only be seen in the Article Preview (see section 2.2.7.1).

NOTE 4: Current browsers do not treat consistently the <JUSTIFY> option, and that is why We have chosen the HTML <DIV> directive to implement that kind of alignment. Generally, one chose a certain alignment for the whole page and then selects paragraphs with different alignments. This is why this feature in the Editor's consists of a checkbox only, having the meaning: align justified the whole document.

2.2.7.1 The Preview function

Using CAMPFIRE, contributors can feed information into CAMPSITE's database. However, the appearance of the article for the general audience will be different than what you see as a contributor. The layout that readers will ultimately see when they visit your web site is controlled by templates, which is described in more detail in Part 3 of this manual.

NOTE 5: the preview function only works once you saved (uploaded) the text form the CAMPFIRE editor, because the preview will display the most recent material in the database.


To use the preview function you need to have the templates created and properly configured, as they are displaying the information from the database to the audience, adding additional layout (navigation, banners, etc.) on the way. If for example you have used CAMPFIRE to add information in the field 'biography', but the template does not include the 'biography' in the final layout, the preview function will not display this information.

2.2.7.2 Previewing the publication

Once all articles are entered and the appropriate templates uploaded, you can preview either the current issue or a single article. To preview the home page, choose the home template and then preview. 

The home page layout depends on a special stand-alone template that can be changed independently. All changes to the template can be previewed as soon as the template has been uploaded. 

Individual articles can be previewed from the 'Articles' area. Simply click 'Preview' to open an extra window with the final page.

NOTE 6: At the bottom of the preview window, you can see information about the parser. If any problems occur while generating the site, the CAMPSITE parser will display error messages. These should help you to identify the problem in the template structure.

2.2.8 Publishing articles
CAMPSITE's copy-flow control feature operates by means of assigning three statuses to an article: new, submitted, and published. 

When you create an article, it is set to 'New'. If you change the status to 'Submit', then - via email - the editors will be informed to check the new submission. Editors will also be informed on new submissions when they login into CAMPSITE. Once the editors are happy with the way the article reads and appears, they can alter its status to 'Published'. Only then article becomes visible on your web site (provided that you have previously published the relevant issue of your publication). The whole process is fully reversible, so you can pull out articles from your site as easily as you can publish them. 

NOTE 7: Only authorized users are allowed to publish articles, so you may not be able to access that option if your administrator has not granted you such rights.


2.2.9 Setting the finalized publication live
All the above functions, such as adding articles, editing, previewing, can be done internally, without any material being available to the public.

Once you decide that the time (or the deadline) has come to bring the new material online, you need to change the status of the issue, by selecting the Publish option from the Issues view. In addition, you can set that 'Public' flag on or off for each and every particular article, hiding it if necessary even if the issue is already published.

2.3. Dictionary
The Dictionary module allows you to create and globally update short pieces of additional information for specific words. For example, some background information on a company or a person might be saved in the Dictionary. In any article where this company or person is marked as a keyword, a link will be displayed, showing additional information. To update this information, the editor only needs to go into the dictionary and update the information there. All changes will happen globally for the entire publication, including back issues.

Depending on the context within which these keywords appear, different types of information can be saved separately. It might, for example, be interesting to know more about the location of a company in one context, in another case it might be crucial to know who is running it. To make such distinctions, the Dictionary module features 'classes', which can be chosen to be displayed. For example, I might decide to mark the name of a person in a political analysis as a keyword. And in this particular context, I wish to have a description of the political career as additional information (as opposed to the past three marriages, which might be interesting in another context). So I need to enter the person's name (e.g. Helmut Kohl) as a keyword in the Dictionary. Later, when writing the article, I can mark Helmut Kohl as a keyword, and then assign the appropriate class (e.g. 'private life' or 'political career') to that incidence of 'Helmut Kohl' in the text.

To make use of the Dictionary function in your daily editing, you need to do the following: 
 define keywords (e.g. Helmut Kohl)
 create classes (e.g. Love Life, Career, Hobbies) 

Once these steps have been taken you can mark keywords inside CAMPFIRE (the Java Editor). Later, when displaying the article, the parser will search the dictionary database for related entries. If such an entry is found, the parser will include a link, allowing the reader to access the additional explanation. If no such entry is found, the word is displayed regularly. 

Changes to the dictionary can happen at any time and will be dynamically included in the display. The marked keyword will always trigger the parser to search through the current version of the dictionary and display the most up to date information.

2.3.1 Creating 'dictionary classes'
From the Home view, select 'Dictionary Classes' where you can add new classes. Here you can also translate the classes into any of the languages defined in CAMPSITE (see section 2.1.1).

2.3.2 Adding keywords to the dictionary
Choose Dictionary from the navigation bar on the left, then select 'Add new keyword'. You will be prompted to type the keyword and specify the language. When finished, the keyword will appear in the list of keywords. Now you have to assign a class to the keyword. Choose 'Classes' in the same line as the keyword to see all available classes. Mark the one you want to associate the keyword with and click 'Done'. You can repeat this process to associate the keyword with more than one class. 

You can also translate the keyword into other languages. This will generate a new keyword in the listing, using the same classes.

2.3.3 Marking keywords in the articles
When writing or editing material in the CAMPFIRE editor, you select the word you want to make a keyword, choose 'Insert' from the pull-down menu and 'Create Keyword'. This will open a window, asking you to choose a class to be associated with the keyword. 

The marked keyword will not necessarily become an active link in the article. This will only happen if the same word has been defined as a keyword, as described above. Only then the parser will find the word in the keyword list and build the link, opening the pop-up window with further information.

2.3.4 What pays the piper, will see the surfer
As the parser is going through the text, it will firstly find the marked keyword, then check in the dictionary if such a word has been defined. If this is the case, the parser will generate a link, opening a popup window, displaying the information of the class of the keyword marked. The other classes are also offered as further reading. 

If the parser detects a keyword, but can not find the same word in the dictionary entry, no link will appear. However, once this keyword is added to the dictionary, the parser will generate a link. Marked keywords are like sleeping beauties. 

2.3.5 Known Limitations of the Dictionary Module
In its present incarnation (CAMPSITE version 2.x.x), the Dictionary module is functional, but its appearance is still, shall we say, rather sobering. We thus consider it as a feature under development, particularly regarding the lack of possibility for CAMPSITE administrators to alter the layout of the popup windows. In other words, you can use it, but you might want to see if the appearance of the pop-up window would not strongly conflict with your overall design. If you decide to continue the dictionary development, please inform us, so we can announce this on our support list.

2.4. Configuring the Subscription Module
CAMPSITE allows you to control access to your site in two ways: 
- Standard UserName:Password pairs, which is suitable for individual users;
- IP Address access, which most institutional subscribers (libraries, universities, NGOs, companies, etc.) tend to prefer

As CAMPSITE handles subscriptions at publication level, all subscription-related variables are customizable from the Publications view. Columns 'Subscription default time' and 'Info' are relevant in this context.

The 'Subscription default time' parameter allows you to set default trial-subscription duration (Trial time) and the default duration of paid subscription (Paid time) for individual countries. To do so, click on Change in the 'Subscription default time' column. You will then have the option to Add new country, i.e. create subscription preferences for a given country. 

If you click on Change in the 'Info' column, you will be able to specify the remainder of subscription parameters for your publication: 
- Pay Time - specifies the time within which the user has to pay for his subscription (in the meantime, he has immediate access to the site); 
- Time-unit - specifies the time unit you would like to use to measure the duration of subscriptions; you can select day, week, month, or year;
- Unit cost - the price for a section for the selected time unit; 
- Currency - the publication's currency. Even if the subscription request is sent and the currency is changed meanwhile, the information about the user's debt is correctly recorded. 

2.4.1 Username:Password Access
CAMPSITE allows readers to subscribe to one publication at a time. Within a publication itself, the level of subscription is the section. The reader is able to select any section from the list of the publication's sections, and for each of them specify the period of time he would like to have a subscription for. 

Before submitting his request, the user (reader) can evaluate the cost of the subscription and change it. At any time later, he can subscribe to additional sections. Once the user has subscribed to a section, he can't increase the period of time for the subscription until payment is done for that section. 

Immediately after the completion of the subscription form, the reader has the right to view the site. By default, the reader has seven days to make a payment and have his subscription confirmed by the administrator or else the account is locked. 

The authorized person can confirm the payment, so that the subscription remains active after the first 7 days. There are two options in the administration module for that: change the value of the amount that the subscriber has to pay, or change the number of days the subscriber is allowed to surf the publication's site. By default, if this sum is set to 0 (zero), the number of paid days is automatically set to the number of requested days.

The administrator (or any other user whose profile allows him to manage publications) has 7 days to confirm the payment. The confirmation is made from the main menu, by selecting User and then Subscriptions. The confirmation consists in changing the payment status (from 'no' to 'yes'). 

2.4.2 Customizing Subscription Interface for Readers
The subscription interface for the user is customizable. Depending on the user's status, several steps must be taken by a user in order to be able to read the publication. There are three possible scenarios:
- the user has never subscribed; the user is served a subscription form (name, login, password, email etc); after the completion of this form, the user can start subscribing to any section
- the user has already subscribed (i.e. is a known user to the system) but only to a few sections, and he wants to add more sections to the subscriptions he has already made, which might have expired; the user should be served a different subscription form (reflecting his status of a known user) 
- the user is not known to the system even though his subscriptions are active (e.g. the subscriber hasn't logged for a long time, even if his subscriptions are active; a login form must be supplied for such a user.

Template designer can customize all those forms by means of CAMPSITE's description language (see Part 3 of this manual). 

2.4.3 IP Address-based Subscriptions
Subscriptions can also be created through the administration interface. This is normally done for two purposes: 

First, an administrator needs to be able to emulate the experience of a regular user in order to test the functionality. So he must be able to create a user identities with reading rights only. 
Second, IP address-based subscription has to be fully controlled by the administrator, as a reader could possibly grant access for 7 days for the whole Internet. 

To create an IP address-based subscription, the administrator first creates a regular UserId:Password account, to which then he adds IP based rights. The double authorization option was implemented because the administrator can't test the subscription from his computer if only the IP address-based authentication is active. He must enter in a different way (UserId:Password) and rights must be assigned as if he were coming from an appropriate IP address. It is not necessary to add anything to the templates or to inform the users who will be accessing the site through IP address authentication of the existence of this UserId:Password pair.

3. CREATING TEMPLATES FOR YOUR PUBLICATION

When implementing CAMPSITE, chances are you will already have a rather clear outline of the structure of your publication online, or - even better - have a running web version already in HTML. Either way, to migrate your publication to CAMPSITE, you will have to generate customized templates for your content. Such templates will be incorporating the CAMPSITE tags used to pull information from the database into the HTML page readable by web browsers.

The following sections will guide you step by step through the process of generating such templates. Before proceeding (step 0 if you like) would be the actual planning and layout work of your web site. This can be done with any HTML editor of your choice. However, the following will cover the transformation of an existing HTML design into templates and NOT web design itself... this ain't no web design lecture.

One of the main goals of CAMPSITE is to offer a fully customizable layout for online publications and at the same time keep the content independent of the layout. This is done by means of templates. Those templates are nothing more than HTML files containing embedded CAMPSITE description-language tags, which creates the link between the view and the content.

3.1. Modular Structure of Templates

A glance at all articles of an online publication reveals that generally there are many layout similarities even across different sections of the publication. Taking advantage of such similarities is what the template structure of CAMPSITE was meant to do. In other words: design features that remain the same for all articles only need to be specified once, e.g. the navigation from an article back to section and home, font type and size, background color and the like. 

On the other hand, there are article components that vary between articles. For example, the top of the article might contain some specific logo to indicate which section it belongs to. In such a case, the templates are designed to work in a modular fashion, allowing you to call up templates within templates.

The modular structure of the templates can be illustrated well by the following example: If background color, font size and type are the same for all articles, they will be specified as plain HTML in the template. But differences between sections will be indicated within the structure of the template (see below) indicating "if this article belongs to the politics section, insert such-and-such template here, if it is sports, insert such-and-such, else: just use the following." 

Templates can be stacked within each other. A template can be made to call another template and include the layout information at the position where it was called in the main template. The easiest way to illustrate this modular structure is by looking at a usual tree structure of folders on a computer. Starting from general categories, the deeper the structure, the more precise and specific the folder names and information.

The modular structure was introduced to keep redundancy to zero and therefore the layout work minimal. Any design changes need to be made only once in the templates, never even twice, if you make full use of this modularity potential. 

3.2. Fixed Framework: Communicating with Your Database
Templates are in-between your content database and your audience on the web. Therefore they need to mediate between both. The database needs to understand what information is requested, and the user's browser needs to retrieve a finished HTML page. 

The template sets the stage, passing specific environmental information to the database query, such as: "list only articles from current issue and section 'sports'." At the same time, it gives detailed instructions on how content should be displayed in HTML format. This distinction between environment and content is crucial for understanding and building templates. The template language was designed to be usable on different levels of dynamic features: one can make static templates for every issue, section, article or just a few customized templates that generate different views depending on the given parameters.

The following will cover some examples on how to build templates. Further down you can find a complete list of available commands used by CAMPSITE templates.

3.3. Building an article template: articletemplate.tpl
Building an article template is the easiest option. All you need to do is generate your HTML layout and substitute the dynamic sections (title, author, intro, text...) with the simple tag:

<!** print article title>

The command is 'print article'; the 'title' part varies. This is the name of the variable that you assigned when building the Article Types. So it could also read:

<!** print article sportsitemdeck>

As the rest of the HTML layout remains as it is, a simple template might look like this:

<html><title><!** print article title></title></head>
<body>
<h1><!** print article title></h1>
<h3><!** print article subtitle></h3>
<i>Written by <!** print article authorname> on the <!**print article date></i><p>
<!** print article text>
</body>
</html>

The reason we can reduce the templates to such a simple solution is, because CAMPSITE will remember where it comes from and where it is. So by the time the user arrives at one particular article, CAMPSITE knows the publication, the issue, the section, and even the article ID and can simply generate the HTML page from the database by using the environmental variables together with the layout information in the template.

Obviously, your design can be far more advanced than this page. And CAMPSITE can also perform far more advanced functions than this. In order to get a feel for this, let's jump into the next example, building the navigation. (A full list of tag commands can be found at the end of this chapter.)

3.4. Generating a Navigation Template: navigationtemplate.tpl

As described above, the template structure can be nested, meaning one template can call another template. This, for example, makes a lot of sense for the navigation. To jump between sections, you might only need one navigation template that can be used by all other templates (article, section, home page). 

To nest another template within another, use the following CAMPSITE tag:

<!** include navigationtemplate.tpl>

The 'include' command is CAMPSITE lingo; the name of the template needs to be adjusted to whatever you called it. Let's assume we add this tag in the article template we created earlier, and we can now go on and build the template.

First thing to do when you are building something like the navigation is to take control over the environmental variables. Our navigation needs to follow some standard rules and should not be affected too much by the environmental setting of the current position of the user. 

In terms of CAMPSITE lingo, we need to introduce a 'local' tag, which allows us to specify some environmental variables for a local section inside the template. In other words, we can switch off the environmental variables, set our own and then switch them on again. In that way we can use the same template for the navigation for all articles, sections, even issues (not publications, obviously). 

In order to make sure you enter the current issue in the navigation bar, set the environment variables to:

<!** local><!** issue current>

Here, 'local' allows you to set the parameters inside a template to the values you want to be specified. Once the parser finds the 'endlocal' tag, it will switch back to the environment variables it arrived with (for example a back issue).

Then the issue parameter is set to 'current'. This is done in order to make sure that the navigation will always jump to the 'section' (or whatever you want) of the current issue. 

Then you would need to specify which section you would want to link to. This is done with the 'section number' tag.

<!** section number 1>

The above tag would set the local section parameter to 1, which will be looked up in the CAMPSITE database under section entries (each section is assigned a number when it is created, see section 2.2.3 of this manual).

Now we have set all necessary values for the link: we will link to section 1 in the current issue. All we need to do now is create the link to the section, or - to be more precise - the template that is used to build section pages.

<a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>">NEWS</a>

This will create an ordinary link, using the anchor tag of HTML. This link will call the sectiontemplate.tpl (you need to substitute sectiontemplate.tpl with your template name). In our example, all templates are in the same folder. If they are in a different folder, you can use a relative link (e.g. look/reporter/logo.gif).

Then we need to pass the parameters to the template, which allows the parser to fill the page with content from the database. So the template is followed by '?' (indicating that other variables are following) and then the CAMPSITE tag 'urlparameters' will include all the information (such as language, publication, etc.) but using the local settings we adjusted earlier (current issue and section 1). Finally, we need to end the local parameters with the tag:

<!** endlocal>

A complete navigation template could look like this:

<!** local><!** issue current><!** section number 1>
<a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>">NEWS</a><br>
<!** endlocal>
<!** local><!** issue current><!** section number 2>
<a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>">POLITICS</a><br>
<!** endlocal>
<!** local><!** issue current><!** section number 3>
<a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>">SPORT</a><br>
<!** endlocal>
<!** local><!** issue current><!** section number 4>
<a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>">CULTURE</a><br>
<!** endlocal>
<!** local><!** issue current><!** section number 5>
<a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>">WEATHER</a><br>
<!** endlocal>

Make sure that the section numbers assigned correlate with the names of the sections, as you assigned them when building the publication in the first place.

Now we can advance into a more conditional environment, the section pages.

3.5. Building the Section Template: sectiontemplate.tpl

The main function of the section page is to provide a table of content for all articles in a section. Each section needs to have its own sectiontemplate.tpl specified. However, you can use one general section template, which will then call different sub-templates, depending on the environmental variables as described above. For example, you can have a different navigations for the sports and the politics sections.

As mentioned before, the main aim of the sectiontemplate.tpl is the listing of all articles in this section, for this issue (and this publication). A very simple list could look like this:

<!** list article>
<a href="articletemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>"><!** print article name></a>
<!** endlist>

This will list all articles in the section. Remember that CAMPSITE will pass on its own environment variables, such as 'publication' and 'issue', to each template. The 'list article' command already knows what section to list. The second line will create the link, using the name of the article. 

Here you can add more information, using the 'print article' command. If you say:

<font size=-1><i><!** print article deck></i></font><hr>

... this will include the 'deck' component (field) of the article, in a smaller font and italics. All HTML remains just the way you always use it. Finally, a line (horizontal rule) is drawn underneath the deck.

To close the listing, use the 'endlist' tag.

This example will order the articles in no particular way. If you want to make sure the newest article is on the top of the list, you need to tell CAMPSITE to order the listing:

<!** list article order bynumber desc>

3.5.1 The 'Feature' article of the section

Most likely, one or more articles are the main (feature) articles in each section. (Editors mark those articles as such by ticking the Show on section page box in Edit Article Details view; for more details see section 2.2.6) What we will do now, is build a listing for the section template, which will display the feature articles (marked with 'show on section page') first and then list the remaining articles.

<!** list article ison section order bynumber desc>

This will make sure that the only articles that will be used which have this feature switched on. They are also ordered by descending numbers, with the newest appearing on the top. This is followed by the variables you want to have listed and the HTML formatting used. In our example it may look like this:

<a href="articletemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>"><!** print article name></a>

We can then add more information from the database with the 'print article' command. HTML code goes in-between.

<!** end list>

Then we need to end the listing with the 'end list' command. So here we will list all the ones which are marked. But what if the editors checked more than one article, but your design only works with ONE article on the top, not all of them? 

3.5.2 Displaying only the most recent feature article on a section page

To use just the most recent article from the 'feature' articles in the section, use the following tag:

<!** list length 1 article ison section order bynumber desc>
<a href="articletemplate.tpl?<!** urlparameters>"><!** print article name></a>
<!** end list>

This will create a list of articles (in our case only one, as the length is set to 1) of the articles marked as 'show on section'. The list will be ordered by descending numbers, the highest entry being featured on the top. As set in this example, this will result in only the most recent entry of "feature" articles within the section being shown.

A link is then created, containing the name of the article (which is the title).

WARNING: If you have built your list in the way described above, only the first article is included. Imagine you have three or four articles checked to 'show on section page', all but the most recent one will be swallowed. This might make sense in some cases, but it might be problematic for other designs.

It might be better to make sure that we are printing the most recent marked one, then the other marked ones and finally the normal articles in the section. So we will keep the first command for our feature article in the section. Then we need to make a list of all articles that are also checked to be 'on section page'. But we need to exclude article number one.

<** list article ison section order bynumber desc>
<!** if list index 1><!** else>
...
<!** endif>
<!** endlist>

This will build the list of all checked articles in the section. It will then look at the index of each article, once it has ordered them. So the newest article will have the index number one. The if condition will find this article and do nothing - because - it runs straight into the 'else' area. Above, where you can see the three dots, you can add your own listing, using the normal 'print article' tag and your HTML code.

Finally, all we need to do is list the remaining articles. That's an easy task--simply exclude the marked ones and list the rest. There you go:

<** list article isnoton section order bynumber desc>
...
<!** endlist>

Again, include your HTML with the other variables in-between.

3.5.3 Including Images in the Section Listing
As seen above, the sectiontemplate.tpl will always pull information out of the database and display it in a list format. If we have images included in the article, they will appear on the article page, but how can we display an individual, small image for one article in the section listing?

The answer is quite simple. Create a body field in your Article Type that will only contain the image that goes into the section listing. Let's say we call this variable 'sectionimage'. Then all you need to add in the section listing to display the image is:

<!** print article sectionimage>

This will then generate the HTML code as saved in the database. And in our case that means it will create the image tag including the image. You could even generate a little subtitle for the image in this field when entering the article text and images.

3.6. Building the home page template: home.tpl

...is more or less the same, just needs some more practice, so this is your chance to practice...

3.7. Some hints: powerful lists and ordering
Listing and ordering are two powerful functions in CAMPSITE lingo. In the following example we would like to automate an update for the sections 3, 4 and 5. Whenever an editor posts some new articles in either of these sections and publishes them, we want the home page to display a link to the newest article in the center column. Also, we want the second newest posting to be listed in the left column.
In order to achieve this, our home page template needs to select sections 3, 4 and 5, then order them from newest to oldest and take the top entry for the center and the second one for the left column.

What do we need to do?

<!** list length 3 section number greater 2>

This will select the sections 3, 4, and 5.

<!** list length 1 article order bynumber desc>

This line orders the entries from newest to oldest and only returns the newest article, because the length of the list is set to one. 

<!** print section name>
<!** print article title>

...to print the most recent for each section.

<!** endlist>
<!** endlist>

... to close the list again.

So, now we need to take the second articles for each section to go into the column on the left. This can be done similar to the example above:

<!** list length 3 section number greater 2>
<!** list length 2 article order bynumber desc>
<!** if list index 1><!** else>
<!** print section name>
<!** print article title>
<!** endlist>
<!** endlist>

3.8. Environmental control with CAMPSITE templates
Instructions within CAMPSITE lingo fall into two categories: those that do not generate output but only select the environment for the rest of the instructions, and those that print a certain information from the database according to the environment set by the first type of instructions.

3.8.1 Runtime given parameters
The information selected also depends on the runtime given parameters. These parameters are:
- language identifier (IdLang) which sets the current language
- publication identifier (IdPubl) which sets the current publication
- issue number (NrIssue) which sets the current issue
- section number (NrSection) which sets the current section
- article number (NrArticle) which sets the article

3.8.2 Other parameters
and also some special parameters:
- the keywords parameter, which specifies that keywords will be used as filters in a List Search statement; it is used for the local search engine
- a list index start, that specifies the starting index for a each type of list: Issue (ILStart), Section (SLStart), Article (ALStart), Article search (SRLstart)

All runtime parameters form the so-called "data context" within which each article is positioned.

3.9. Structure of CAMPSITE templates

The structure of the CAMPSITE templates is simple. It is a continuous row of either HTML language or the commands used by CAMPSITE to pull content out of the database. Any template in its most simplified form looks like this:

[HTML text] [CAMPSITE Instruction] [HTML text ] [CAMPSITE Instruction] ....

The following example is an HTML beginning of a CAMPSITE template. In general, the best way to go about making templates is to finish the HTML layout work, then identify the chunks that do not need any changes and insert CAMPSITE tags in-between to customize the layout. 

<html><body><h1>template 1</h1></body></html>

This template does not contain CAMPSITE Instructions. Taking this example a little bit further, the above example could be asked to display the day of the month.

<html><body> <!** Date mday> </body></html>

This template is made of:

HTML text 			<html><body> 
CAMPSITE Instruction 	<!** Date mday> 
HTML text 			</body></html>

...and will print the day of the month (numeric) for the current date. You can see the most important format standard that will follow all work through the pages to come, the CAMPSITE tag. Requests to CAMPSITE to replace a part of the template with information from the database is always inside the <!** > tag. 

Template 3:

<html><body>
<!** List Article IsOn FrontPage>
<p> Article Name <!** Print Article name>
<!** EndList>
</body></html>

This template is made of:

HTML text 			<html><body>
CAMPSITE Instruction 	<!** List Article IsOn FrontPage>
HTML text 			<p> Article Name 
CAMPSITE Instruction 	<!** Print Article name>
CAMPSITE Instruction 	<!** EndList>
HTML text 			</body></html>

...and will print the names of articles that are on the front page, no matter if they are protected or not by the subscription system.

Beware that depending on the given runtime parameters this template will print different information. For example, if only NrIssue parameter is specified, this template will select all articles to be shown on the front page, for the given issue number, for all publications.

3.9.1 'Define-environment' instructions
The syntax of the language is as follows: All identifiers written between '<' and '>' contain values. The '|' character is used to mark possible expression and means the logical 'OR' between its operands. For example, one could write: option1|option2|option3 meaning option1 or option2 or option3. Terms enclosed by '[' and ']' means that the content doesn't need to appear. The syntax is flexible.

In several cases (for site maps for example), local parameters are created with the same values as the original ones (from template start); within the local block the original parameters may be needed.

Syntax:
URLParameters [Image <image_number>]
|[allsubtitles]
Print the current parameters, specifying eventually that the current article will be treated as a unit, instead of a group of paragraphs (allsubtitles).

URLParameters fromstart
Prints the parameters received at the start of template (useful when building sitemaps).

FormParameters [fromstart]
Print the current/original parameters.

URLParameters reset_<environment level>_list
Reset list counters for all level bellow the specified one.

Examples:

URLParameters reset_issue_list
  - reset list counters for all the lists (issue, section, article, searchresult, subtitle)
URLParameters reset_section_list
  - reset list counters for the following lists: section, article, searchresult, subtitle
URLParameters reset_article_list
  - reset list counters for the following lists: article, searchresult, subtitle
URLParameters reset_searchresult_list
  - reset list counters for the following lists: searchresult, subtitle
URLParameters reset_subtitle_list
  - reset list counters for the following lists: subtitle

You can add the other valid parameters to URLParameters before or after these reset_*_list parameters.

Example:
Suppose the data context is set to Language 1 (identifier), Publication 2 (identifier), Issue 3 (number), Section 6 (number). The string created for printing is:
IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=2&NrIssue=3&NrSection=6
for URLParameters, and
<input type=hidden name=IdPublication value="2">
<input type=hidden name=NrIssue value="3">
<input type=hidden name=NrSection value="6">
for FormParameters respectively.

If Image is specified on URLParameters, the parameters for <image_number> of the article specified in the data context will be printed.

Example:
IdPublication=2&NrIssue=3&NrSection=6&NrArticle&NrImage=4

Constraints:
None.

5. APPENDIX II - CHARACTER SETS AND LANGUAGES

Covering non-ASCII character sets requires standards to make such special characters cross-platform compatible. Some standards have been set over the past years and are already implemented in most browsers. These are:


Code Page	Character Set
ISO-8859-1	Latin 1 I
ISO-8859-2	Latin 2
ISO-8859-3	Latin 3
ISO-8859-4	Baltic
ISO-8859-5	Cyrillic
ISO-8859-6	Arabic
ISO-8859-7	Greek
ISO-8859-8	Hebrew
ISO-8859-9	Turkish
ISO-8859-15	Latin 9 

Multilingual support has been developed in various projects, independently from each other, resulting in some confusion and a lack of consistent standards. Recently those efforts have been channeled into a new universal standard called Unicode. Unicode tries to encapsulate all previously defined character sets, expanding the bytes used to represent each character. For more information on the Unicode project, see the official web site: http://www.unicode.org/

Because different vendors had already created different versions of Unicode characters, we have endowed CAMPSITE with a generic translation table so that characters represented with one byte can be seen within this application without any special configurations on the client side.

IMPORTANT: The configuration of your local machine must be set for multilingual support. 

Below you can find the best matches for individual languages and the appropriate character sets:

Latin1 covers most West European languages, such as French (fr), Spanish (es), Catalan (ca), Basque (eu), Portuguese (pt), Italian (it), Albanian (sq), Rhaeto-Romanic (rm), Dutch (nl), German (de), Danish (da), Swedish (sv), Norwegian (no), Finnish (fi), Faroese (fo), Icelandic (is), Irish (ga), Scottish (gd), and English (en), incidentally also Afrikaans (af) and Swahili (sw), thus in effect also the entire American continent, Australia and much of Africa. The most notable exceptions are Zulu (zu) and other Bantu languages using Latin Extended-B letters, and of course Arabic in North Africa, and Guarani (gn) missing GEIUY with ~ tilde. The lack of the ligatures Dutch IJ, French OE and ,,German` quotation marks is considered tolerable. The lack of the new C=-resembling Euro currency symbol U+20AC has opened the discussion of a new Latin0. 
Latin1 has also been adopted as the first page of ISO 10646 (Unicode).
Latin1 is HTML's base charset but HTML has now been globalized through RFC 2070.

Latin2 covers the languages of Central and Eastern Europe: Czech (cs), Hungarian (hu), Polish (pl), Romanian (ro), Croatian (hr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Sorbian. For Romanian the S and T had better use commas instead of cedilla as in Turkish: the U+015F LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH CEDILLA at =BA ought to be read as U+0219 LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH COMMA BELOW etc. The German Umlaute 隘廻 are found at exactly the same positions in Latin1, Latin2, Latin3, Latin4, Latin5, Latin6. Thus you can write German and Polish with Latin2 or German and Turkish with Latin5 but there is no 8bit charset to properly mix German and Russian, for instance. 

Latin3 is popular with authors of Esperanto (eo) and Maltese (mt), and it covered Turkish before the introduction of Latin5 in 1988. 

Latin4 introduced letters for Estonian (et), the Baltic languages Latvian (lv, Lettish) and Lithuanian (lt), Greenlandic (kl) and Lappish. Note that Latvian requires the cedilla on the =BB U+0123 LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH CEDILLA to jump on top. Latin4 was followed by Latin6. 

Latin5: With these Cyrillic letters you can type Bulgarian (bg), Belarusian (be), Macedonian (mk), Russian (ru), Serbian (sr) and pre-1990 (no ghe with upturn) Ukrainian (uk). The ordering is based on the (incompatibly) revised GOST 19768 of 1987 with the Russian letters except for  sorted by Russian alphabet (ABVGDE). Some still prefer to use in their applications the Ukrainian character set, KOI8-U.

Latin6: This is the Arabic alphabet. Unfortunately the basic alphabet for Arabic (ar) does not containing the four extra letters for Persian (fa) nor the eight extra letters for Pakistani Urdu (ur). This fixed font is not well-suited for text display. Each Arabic letter occurs in up to four (2) presentation forms: initial, medial, final or separate. To make Arabic text legible you'll need a display engine that analyses the context and combines the appropriate glyphs on top of a handler for the reverse writing direction shared with Hebrew. Introduced in 1992, Latin6 rearranged the Latin4 characters, dropped some symbols and the Latvian &rcedil;, added the last missing Inuit (Greenlandic Eskimo) and non-Skolt Sami (Lappish) letters and reintroduced the Icelandic 縱 to cover the entire Nordic area. Skolt Sami still needs a few more accents. Note that RFC 1345 and GNU recode contain errors and use a preliminary and different latin6.

7. APPENDIX IV: INSTALLING CAMPSITE ON A STANDARD RED HAT 7.0 SERVER

The following is a possible session, which would install CAMPSITE on your remote host. All text in square brackets is comment only, not to be typed.

localhost$ telnet youserverIP
Red Hat Linux release 7.0 (Guiness)
Kernel 2.2.16-22 onan i386
login : user
Password: userpwd
Last login...
yourserver$ su
yourserver$ passowrd: pwdsu
yourserver# cd /usr/local/ [or any other directory where you want to have the software installed]

yourserver# ftp www.campware.org
Connected to www.campware.org
Name (...): anonymous
Password: your@email.com
ftp> cd pub/campsite/source/campsite_V1/
ftp> get campsiteversion.tar.gz [change the file name to the one you want to get]
ftp> bye

yourserver# gzip -df campsiteversion.tar.gz
yourserver# tar -xf campsiteversion.tar

[Now you need to edit the httpd.conf file. Locate the file first by typing]
yourserver# updatedb [if you haven't generated the database for locating yet]
yourserver# locate httpd.conf

[Make a backup copy, always a good idea.]
yourserver# cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bak [the location might vary, depending on your configuration and system version]

[Now open and edit the config file, you can see the changes that need to be done in the INSTALL file which is located in the campsite folder. Then you need to restart the http daemon:]
yourserver# kill -HUP `cat /var/run/httpd.pid` [the `` need to be angled from top left to bottom right.]

[Check if mysql and httpd are running:]
yourserver# ps -A | grep mysql [this should return some lines with pid numbers for the mysqld. If not, start mysql manually]

yourserver# ps -A | grep httpd [this should return some lines with pid numbers for the httpd. If not, start httpd manually (see above)]
yourserver# cd campsite

[Edit the Makefile according to the folder location of the html and cgi-bin file, specified in the httpd.conf file (see above). Edit only in the first three lines of the Makefile - if necessary at all. Currently it should work fine for standard installattions of Red Hat 7.0 and Apache.]
yourserver# make
yourserver# make install
yourserver# exit

[that's all...]

8. APPENDIX V - BACKING UP DATABASES IN MYSQL 

In order to make a backup of your CAMPSITE database, do the following:

1.change to superuser
2.type: mysqldump campsite > yourname-db.sql

In order to delete your CAMPSITE database from MySQL, do the following:

1.type: mysqladmin drop campsite
2.confirm with 'y'

In order to load your backed up  CAMPSITE database, do the following:

1.create the campsite database by typing: mysqladmin create campsite
2.edit the backup file you created and add the first line: use campsite;
(make sure you finish the line with a semicolon and do not start the line with a hash, which would mean it is only a comment).
3.load the database by typing: mysql campsite < yourname-db.sql
