<p><b>INTRODUCTION<a name="introduction"></a></b></p>
<P>CAMPSITE is a content management system with multilingual Unicode support,
  designed for medium-to-large-size online news publications. Issues, copy flow,
  back archives, as well as subscription management are fully implemented features.
  At the core of CAMPSITE is CAMPFIRE, the Java Editor supporting Unicode, which
  allows contributors and editors to publish content and control layout online
  in their native alphabets. Formatting can be altered in a similar way as in
  editors such as Wordpad, meaning that no HTML knowledge is necessary for formatting
  text.</P>
<P>The original CAMPSITE concept was developed by Center for Advanced Media-Prague
  (<a href="http://www.mdlf-camp.net" target="_blank">C@MP</a>) in collaboration
  with Transitions Online, which started using CAMPSITE in late 2000. DNT-Cluj
  (<a href="http://www.dntcj.ro" target="_blank">http://www.dntcj.ro</a>) and
  Recognos (<a href="http://www.recognos.com" target="_blank">http://www.recognos.com</a>),
  software companies based in Cluj, Romania accomplished original coding and part
  of the further development. For a detailed revision history, click here. CAMPSITE
  in action can be seen at the Transitions Online web site (<a href="http://www.tol.cz" target="_blank">http://www.tol.cz</a>).</P>
<P>You can test drive CAMPSITE at the campware project site (<a href="http://www.campware.org" target="_blank">http://www.campware.org</a>)
  and take a look at its features. Mail us for a login (<a href="mailto:contact@campware.org">contact@campware.org</a>).</P>
<P>CAMPSITE tech specs in a nutshell:</P>
<P>CAMPSITE server:</P>
<ul>
  <li> runs on a Linux server, originally tested on RedHat 7.0 release, and has proven
  compatible with Mandrake 8.0.
  <li> requires an Apache web server to be running, and its virtual servers configured
  by the administrator.
  <li> needs a MySQL database server for Linux to be able to store data. The tests were
  made on MySQL v.3.23.36.
</ul>
<P>CAMPSITE client side:</P>
<ul>
  <li> runs on Netscape under Unix, Windows (versions up to 4.7), and Macintosh
    (see known limitations for the Mac), and Internet Explorer under Windows.</li>
  <li> requires local installation of customized Java-class packages (At the moment
    of the publishing of this manual, an installer is available for Windows 98,
    Me, and 2000). </li>
</ul>

<P>1. <b>INSTALLATION GUIDE</b><a name="1."></a></P>
<P>1.1. <b>Requirements</b><a name="1.1."></a></P>
<P>The server part of the application runs on a Linux computer. It was originally
  developed and tested on RedHat 7.0 release, and it has proven compatible with
  Mandrake 8.0.</P>
<P>Before installing CAMPSITE, make sure you have two other applications up and
  running:</P>
<P>1. Apache web server - your http daemon, serving your web site to the world</P>
<P>&#9;<a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_blank">http://www.apache.org</a></P>
<P>&#9;For installation instructions, see the Apache web site. Installing Apache
  will generate the httpd.conf file referred to further down. This file contains
  all relevant information for Apache to handle the content on your Linux server.
  The adjustments described below need to be made in order to tell Apache about
  the procedures for CAMPSITE files and templates.</P>
<P>2. MySQL Database Server - this application handles the CAMPSITE database. The
  tests were made on MySQL v.3.23.36.</P>
<P>&#9;<a href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a></P>
<P>Three components of MySQL are needed for CAMPSITE:</P>
<ol>
  <li> the server for i386 systems, </li>
  <li>client programs for i386 systems and </li>
  <li> files and libraries for development for i386 systems.</li>
</ol>
<P>All of those can be found on the MySQL website. </P>
<P>When installing on Red Hat, try to find the section 'Standard Binary RPMs'
  which have been compiled especially for Red Hat and should cause the least hassle.
  You can install these filed on prompt level by typing 'rpm -t nameoffile.rpm'
  (without the '').</P>
<P>1.2. <b>TODO</b><a name="1.2."></a></P>
<P>Here is what you need to do. </P>
<P>1.2.1 Configure the Web server<a name="1.2.1"></a></P>
<P>First you need to change the behavior of the http daemon (the Web server).
  The configuration file, called httpd.conf, is normally found in the /etc/httpd/conf/
  folder (N.B. non-standard installation of the Apache server can change the location
  of the file). The changes you have to apply to the file are:</P>
<P>- activate the DirectoryIndex directive and add to it the following options:<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">DirectoryIndex index.xql /priv/templates/idx.xql</font></P>
<P>- activate the IndexIgnore directive and set it to<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">IndexIgnore *</font></P>
<P>- add the following lines:<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddHandler www-sql .xql <br>
  Action www-sql /cgi-bin/www-sql<br>
  AddHandler tpl_handler .tpl<br>
  Action tpl_handler /cgi-bin/tpl_cgi</font></P>
<P>- make sure that the server has the rights to read, write and execute in the
  folder where the file are stored and uploaded. Standardly, the user and group
  should be set as 'httpd'; the rights should be set as 'rwx' for the user and
  'rw' for the group. Consult the Linux Administration Guide for further information.
  Furthermore, the Web server should have activated the UniqueID option (the mod_unique_id
  should be loaded)</P>
<P>- restart the httpd daemon:<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">killall httpd<br>
  {PATH}/httpd</font></P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">(or /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart)</font></P>
<P>- a public free CGI, we used 'www-sql', must be configured to allow the 'exec'
  directive activated and to allow recursivity. The package we supply is well
  configured, but if you want to install a newer version of www-sql later (for 
  further development and other purposes) make sure to compile it with these options.</P>
<P>1.2.2 <b>Customize the application framework</b><a name="1.2.2"></a></P>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the CAMPSITE archive in a directory on the server.</li>
  <li> Unarchive it using the command: tar xzvf &lt;campsite_archive&gt;</li>
  <li>Enter campsite directory.</li>
  <li>Edit the campsite/Makefile file to reflect your directory structure:<br>
    WWW_DIR - www directory<br>
    REL_CGI_BIN - cgi directory (relative to www directory)<br>
    REL_HTML - html directory (relative to www directory)<br>
    HTTP_USER - apache user (the user apache server runs with)<br>
    HTTP_GROUP - apache group (the group apache server runs with)<br>
    Run './install', answer the install questions and wait for the application to be installed.<br>
    </li>
</ol>
<P>1.2.3 <b>The CAMPFIRE Java Editor</b><a name="1.2.3"></a></P>
<P>At the heart of CAMPSITE's client interface, lies CAMPFIRE, a text editor implemented 
  as a Java Applet. To enable this applet to work, you must copy install certain 
  (still) non-standard Java classes on your local workstation(s). </P>
<P>The files you need to install locally are swingall.jar and unicoded.zip, both 
  of which you should have created when you unpacked the campsite archive (campsite-2.x.x.tar.gz). 
  Both of these files should be unpacked in the folders where Java classes are 
  regularly stored. The breakdown according to browser/operating system is as 
  follows:</P>
<ol>
  <li> Netscape under Unix: /usr/lib/netscape/java/classes</li>
  <li> Internet Explorer under Mac OS 9.x: see Known Limitations: Apple Macintosh 
    below</li>
  <li> Netscape under Windows (up to version 4.7): /Program Files/Netscape/Communicator/java/classes<br>
    N.B. swingall.jar should not be unpacked, just drop it in the above folder</li>
  <li> Internet Explorer under Windows (all versions): /Windows/java/classes <br>
    z .B. An installer is currently available for Windows 98, Me, and 2000 (Not 
    NT!!)</li>
</ol>
<P>TECH NOTE: The need to install Swing on workstations will disappear with the 
  evolution of browsers, which will have this module native in their built-in 
  Java Virtual Machines. The file is distributed freely and is native with the 
  JDK 1.2 package.</P>
<P>1.2.4 <b>KNOWN LIMITATIONS: Apple Macintosh</b><a name="1.2.4"></a></P>
<P>Due to the limitations related to the length of file names under Mac OS (up 
  to 9.x), the Java virtual machine doesn't act as it should (Java compiler generates 
  long names for the so-called inner classes). Our tests have proven that the 
  original installation kit for Swing, provided by Sun Microsystems and Apple 
  doesn't install properly the libraries, while the .jar file format is not recognized 
  by the Java Virtual Machine (called MRJ under Mac OS). Human interaction is 
  required as follows:</P>
<ol>
  <li> install the MRJ file (version MRJ 2.2 is available at the time of publishing 
    of this document; the latest version can be found at: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/download.html" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/java/download.html</a></li>
  <li> install the Swing packet (Swing version 1.1.8 is currently available, but 
    the latest version can be found at <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/download.html" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/download.html</a></li>
  <li> move the swingall.jar (which has been created by the Swing installation 
    kit in step 2) to a PC computer and unpack it there, then re-pack it with 
    a .zip extension (instead of .jar) an copy it back on the Mac. This will allow 
    Swing-based applets to be run under Internet Explorer for Mac. The problem 
    of loading classes from the local file system has not been solved yet, so 
    the multilingual support feature does not work on the Mac. Hopefully System 
    X should bring good news in this respect.</li>
</ol>
<P>1.2.5 <b>KNOWN LIMITATIONS: MS Windows/Netscape</b><a name="1.2.5"></a></P>
<P>CAMPFIRE v. 1.0.0 works in Netscape versions up to 4.7. Although Netscape 6 
  (Gecko) has native support for Swing, its makers have diverged from the original 
  Sun Microsystems specification, so they are not compatible with CAMPFIRE. The 
  simple installer provided for Windows (98, Me, and 2000), will thus not install 
  the Swing classes for Netscape if version 6 is detected on the workstation. 
  What's more, pre-Gecko versions do not support normal cut and paste (ctrl-C 
  and ctrl-V) features for Java, so you have to use the special clipboard button 
  on the browser in order to emulate this functionality.</P>
<P>In short, if you are working under Windows and want to run CAMPFIRE with the 
  least hassle, our advice is to stick to Internet Explorer. Not only is the cutting 
  and pasting easier, but the applet runs faster, as it is able to use decompressed 
  swing classes (instead of the swing.jar archive that Netscape accesses to run 
  CAMPFIRE). </P>
<P>1.2.6 <b>HOWTO</b><a name="1.2.6"></a></P>
<P>The system's default administrator authentication is: admin:admn00. The interface 
  of the application can be found at the address:<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">http://&lt;servername&gt;/priv/</font></P>
<P>The publication can be seen at the address name configured in the application:<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">http://&lt;publication site name&gt;</font></P>
<P>The parser runs automatically.</P>

<P> </P>
<P><b>PART II: PUBLISHING ONLINE WITH CAMPSITE</b><a name="part2"></a></P>
<P>2. <b>BRINGING YOUR PUBLICATIONS ONLINE WITH CAMPSITE</b><a name="2."></a></P>
<P>CAMPSITE enables you to publish (host) multiple multilingual publications (web 
  sites) on the same server. The process can be roughly divided in four steps:</P>
<ul>
  <li>configuring the publishing environment (establishing access rights, country-relevant 
    information, languages you intend to publish in, subscription, etc.)</li>
  <li>establishing the structure of your publications</li>
  <li>creating the templates which determine the look and feel of your publications</li>
  <li>adding content and managing your publications</li>
</ul>
<P>2.1. <b>Configuring the publishing environment</b><a name="2.1."></a></P>
<P>Your first step on the road to bringing your publications online with CAMPSITE 
  is to configure the publishing environment. This involves setting up parameters 
  such as languages that you are or will be publishing in, definition of typical 
  user types, and the very structure of your publication(s). </P>
<P>After you log in for the first time with the default user name (admin) and 
  password (admn00) you will reach administrator's interface </P>
<P>The left frame contains a list of modules that you can access, while the right 
  frame displays the currently selected module. </P>
<P>CAMPSITE appears differently to different users. Each user sees only the options 
  that he or she has the right to access or alter. A typical back-end user (an 
  editor or journalist) will get to see only a fraction of the options available 
  to a fully authorized user (such as the default administrator).</P>
<P>2.1.1 <b>Languages</b><a name="2.1.1"></a></P>
<P>While CAMPSITE's default language is English, you are by no means limited to 
  publishing in that language only. It's actually very much au contraire.</P>
<P>The language module enables you to configure support for languages that you 
  wish to publish in. If your tongues of choice happen to be absent from the list 
  of CAMPSITE's pre-configured languages, you can configure your own languages.</P>
<P>To do so, enter the Languages module and click on Add new language. You should 
  enter the language name (both in English and in the language itself), its code 
  (e.g. HR for Croatian), the code page you wish to use for that language (e.g. 
  ISO-8859-4 for Baltic character sets), and the names of months and days of the 
  week. </P>
<P>For an extensive description of languages and code pages, see <a href="#5.">Appendix 
  II</a>.</P>
<P>2.1.2 <b>Countries</b><a name="2.1.2"></a></P>
<P>This module determines how country lists will appear in user-profile forms. 
  The module allows you to create country lists in different languages. </P>
<P>When you click on Add new country, you will be prompted to enter the country's 
  name in a language of your choice as well as the country's code. The language 
  dropdown menu will contain as many languages as you have defined in the Languages 
  module (see section <a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>). </P>
<P>N.B. The language you are asked to specify is the language in which you are 
  entering a country's name, *NOT* the language spoken in the country!</P>
<P>2.1.3 <b>User Management<a name="2.1.3"></a></b></P>
<P>CAMPSITE's user management module allows you to control access to the backend 
  and the front end of your publication(s). In other words, the module, which 
  features a search option, allows you to define who will have the right to manage 
  and edit content on your sight and who will be allowed to read it.</P>
<P>2.1.3.1 <b>Backend Access: Creating User Types<a name="2.1.3.1"></a></b></P>
<P>A user is generally defined by the list of the tasks he or she has and is allowed 
  to do in a system. In CAMPSITE, this list of tasks ranges from creating, managing, 
  and editing publications, sections, and articles, to template management and 
  definition of the publishing environment. </P>
<P>To simplify user management, CAMPSITE allows you to create generic user types, 
  which can then be assigned to multiple users, instead of taking care of every 
  single access right for every single user. </P>
<P>CAMPSITE comes "out of the box" with three default user types:</P>
<ul>
  <li>Administrator - user with full authorization, i.e. all rights (normally 
    reserved to webmasters)</li>
  <li>Editor - standard backend user with rights limited to basic article management 
    and editing (normally assigned to journalists and editors)</li>
  <li>Reader - the profile limited to viewing the site, i.e. front end only. </li>
</ul>
<P>User-management module operations are straightforward: </P>
<P>To create your custom user profiles, click on User types and then on Add new 
  user type. To add a user, click on Users and choose Add new user account. </P>
<P>You should specify the full name of the user, user name, password, and choose 
  a predefined user type (i.e. one of the default types or your custom user types). 
  If you would like to further fine tune the rights assigned to a particular user, 
  go to Users and click on Rights in the same line with the user's name. </P>
<P>2.1.3.2 <b>Front-End Access: Subscription</b><a name="2.1.3.2"></a> </P>
<P>CAMPSITE allows you to control public access to your publication(s) through 
  its built-in subscription module, about whose configuration you can read more 
  in section <a href="#2.4.">2.4</a>)</P>
<P>For now, you should know that all articles you create in your CAMPSITE publication(s) 
  are by default available to subscribers only. Publication editors or administrators 
  have the right to make an article accessible to non-subscribers. </P>
<P>The way it works from readers' side is as follows:</P>
<P>If a reader tries to access a non-public article, she is informed that she 
  is not allowed to read the article but is provided with an option to subscribe 
  immediately to that article or other articles or the whole publication. A temporary 
  7-day subscription is activated immediately. During this period, the reader 
  has a chance to effect the payment and consequently have her subscription extended 
  by the administrator. </P>
<P>The publication's administrator is automatically notified of all new subscriptions 
  by e-mail. Subscribers also receive automatically generated e-mail reminders 
  that their subscription is expiring four days before the event. </P>
<P>2.2. <b>Creating publications<a name="2.2."></a></b></P>
<P>CAMPSITE has a clear four-tier hierarchical structure, which conforms to the 
  traditional structure of news publications. Each publication is thus made up 
  of issues; each issue is in turn made up of sections, which are themselves comprised 
  of articles. </P>
<P>CAMPSITE's user interface is straightforward. A site map is present on every 
  screen, which enables easy navigation from one level to another.</P>
<P>Each module of the publication is associated to a level. By clicking on the 
  name of the module, you enter the structure of the next level or you edit the 
  current module, depending on its position.</P>
<P>For example, after creating the "Prague Times" publication, by clicking on 
  'Prague Times' in the list of publications, you enter the list of issues for 
  "Prague Times". By clicking the name of an issue, you enter its list of sections. 
  By clicking the name of a section you enter the article list. By clicking the 
  article name you enter the article structure and can edit the different components 
  (fields) of the article.</P>
<P>2.2.1 <b>Creating a new publication<a name="2.2.1"></a></b></P>
<P>To create a new publication, you need to enter the Publications module. Once 
  you are there, click on Add new publication. </P>
<P><font color="#000099">NOTE 1: If you are not the default administrator, you 
  may not be able to see the Add new publication option. You may want to ask your 
  site administrator to alter your access rights. Bear in mind, however, that 
  a good administrator would be reluctant to hand over those rights to more than 
  a handful of people. If you are not among those select few, your Publications 
  view will only contain a list of publications hosted on this particular CAMPSITE 
  server.</font></P>
<P>At this point, you should specify the following:</P>
<ul>
  <li>Name of the publication (e.g. "Prague Times")</li>
  <li>Site - the name of the server (or IP address) on which your publication 
    will be hosted (e.g. www.praguetimes.net) and on which it will ultimately 
    accessible to readers.</li>
  <li>Language - the default language of the publication</li>
  <li>Pay time - the period within which readers have to pay for their subscription, 
    i.e. the length of free trial subscription. (See section <a href="#2.4">2.4</a> 
    for more details.)</li>
</ul>
<P>Any of those parameters can be altered or fine-tuned at a later stage.</P>
<P><font color="#000099">NOTE 2: CAMPSITE allows multiple publications to be hosted 
  on the same server (computer), but to make different publications directly accessible 
  to readers, you need to specify different virtual web servers. For example, 
  if you want to add another publication (e.g. "Moldovan Contemporary Political 
  Thought") onto the server on which you are hosting your "Prague Times" publication, 
  you need to assign it a different virtual web server name (e.g. www.moldovanthought.com)</font></P>
<P>If you have vhosts set up in your Apache configuration, you can start a new 
  publication and specify the URL for this vhost, which will then allow the users 
  to access your publication through that address.</P>
<P>2.2.2 <b>Creating a new issue<a name="2.2.2"></a></b></P>
<P>Once you have successfully created your first publication, click on its name 
  (e.g. "Prague Times"). This will lead you to the Add new issue option, on which 
  you should duly click to proceed with the creation of the structure of your 
  publication. </P>
<P>The options you will be presented with are Create a new structure and Use the 
  structure of the previous issue. If you are creating a new publication from 
  the ground up, the first option one is your only real choice. </P>
<P>The second option will be the one to choose once you are ready to publish additional 
  issues of your publication, because it allows you to automatically create a 
  new issue with the same logical structure (sections) as the preceding one. Sections 
  are created but are empty, so that you can begin to add articles immediately. 
  You should possibly only change the name of the new issue, because it will otherwise 
  remain the same as the last issue. The templates, however, are not copied, so 
  the new issue must be linked to a template for the front page (see Note 3 for 
  more details). </P>
<P>You can introduce changes to the structure of the issue you just created, including 
  adding or deleting sections or adding new article types, changing field lists 
  within article types, etc.</P>
<P><font color="#000099">NOTE 3: If you are copying the structure of an old issue, 
  you need to connect the new issue to a front-page template (see Section 3 of 
  this manual). If you are not bent on changing the look of your publication, 
  just select the old template; If you wish to alter the visual layout of your 
  publication, you should select a new template that you have meanwhile created. 
  Regardless of your choice, old issues will keep their original layout (unless 
  you go back and change their template associations manually for each of them).</font></P>
<P>Whichever option you choose, be it to replicate the structure of the last issue 
  or create a brand new structure, you will be able to change the name, the default 
  language and the number of the issue. </P>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
  <tr> 
    <td>TIP: While you can always go back and change the name and the default 
      language of an issue at any time, the issue number cannot be changed once 
      it is specified. If you are planning to add older issues of your newspaper/static-HTML 
      site at a later stage to the same CAMPSITE publication, you may consider 
      continuing the series. For example, if you just published issue 154 of Prague 
      Times in static HTML before moving to CAMPSITE, you could assign number 
      155 to the first issue you are creating within CAMPSITE.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>2.2.3 <b>Add new sections to an issue<a name="2.2.3"></a></b></P>
<P>Entering the Sections view for an Issue, you can add new sections to the current 
  issue by clicking on Add new section. You should specify the name and section 
  number (within the issue). While you can come back later and change the name 
  of the section, the section number can be chosen only at the time when the new 
  section is added.</P>
<P>2.2.4 <b>Defining article types<a name="2.2.4"></a></b></P>
<P>The next step in setting up your publication is to define the types of articles 
  that you intend to publish on your site. What you are actually doing at this 
  stage is specifying the way articles will appear to the person who will be adding 
  content to your publications. For example, a feature story is likely to have 
  more components than a brief news item. </P>
<P>To create an article type, click on Article types and then select Add new article 
  type. First, you should pick a name for your article type (N.B. only letters 
  are allowed, no spaces or special characters). Then you can start adding fields 
  to the article type by clicking on 'New field' option (or proceed to add other 
  article types by choosing 'Add another'). You will be requested to specify the 
  name of the field (e.g. Author, Date, Deck, Body, AuthorBiography -- remember 
  no spaces or special characters are allowed!). </P>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
  <tr> 
    <td>TIP: Try to give intuitive names to your article types and fields within 
      them, because chances are that you will not be the only person doing the 
      publishing. For example, if you have an article type that you would like 
      to use in your sports section, call it Sportsarticle, not Sp or Artic or 
      anything equally cryptic. It will save you time and nerves when journalists 
      and admin staff start doing all of the posting (and all of the consequent 
      asking). Similarly, when creating an article type, try to make the sequence 
      of fields logical, i.e. close to the way they will appear to the readers 
      on the site (e.g. Author - Date -Deck - Articlebody - Bibliography). At 
      this stage of development, CAMPSITE does not allow reordering of fields 
      within article types.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>After you name the field, you have to specify its type. There are three options:</P>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Text</b> - this type of field can contain a maximum of 265 characters. 
    It does not support HTML tags and it its appearance/formatting/character set 
    is entirely determined by the template (see section 3 for more information 
    on templates).</li>
  <li> <b>Date</b> - this is a standard date field with a fixed syntax of YYYY-MM-DD</li>
  <li> <b>Body</b> - this type of field can be up to 64KB in size (database space 
    is, however, used optimally, as the database server adjusts the size on the 
    disk to be sure the field fits, so there is no waste of space). More important, 
    this type of field is edited with CAMPSITE's near-WYSIWYG Java editor -- CAMPFIRE. 
    CAMPFIRE enables you to enter text in any character set or alphabet, and even 
    in multiple alphabets. Text entered through CAMPFIRE is independent of the 
    format and character set specified by the template. Moreover, CAMPFIRE allows 
    you to insert images, links, and formatting tags, as well as special CAMPSITE 
    Dictionary tags.</li>
</ul>
<P>After you have specified the field type, you can keep on adding fields to the 
  article type or finish the operation. Anytime later you can add more fields 
  to the article type without affecting the rest of the application or the database 
  contents. You will not lose articles if you add fields to their particular article 
  type. </P>

<P>2.2.5 <b>Creating articles within a section<a name="2.2.5"></a></b></P>
<P>Once you are in the Articles view within a section (you get there by clicking 
  on a section name), you can create new articles by selecting the Add new article 
  option. (This is a recursive option that allows you to add any given number 
  of articles to the current section.) </P>
<P>Once you are in the Add new article view, you will see a dialog box with the 
  following fields/options:</P>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Name</b>: This field is mandatory, because it determines how your article 
    will be known to the database and appear in the Articles view. You, however, 
    have the liberty of renaming the article at any time.</li>
  <li><b>Type</b>: you have to select one of the available article types from 
    the dropdown menu. The choice you make at this stage cannot be altered later.</li>
  <li><b>Language</b>: select the language in which you want to create your article 
    from the dropdown menu. The list of languages will contain the languages you 
    have defined in the Languages module (see section<a href="#2.1.1"> 2.1.1</a>). 
    The language choice you make at this stage is final, though you can always 
    create a version in another language with the Translate option in the Articles 
    view.</li>
  <li><b>Show article on front page</b>: Tick this box if you would like the article 
    to be displayed on your publication's front (home) page. You can alter this 
    choice at any time.</li>
  <li><b>Show article on section page</b>: Tick this box if you would like the 
    article to be displayed on the main (home) page (a section "homepage") of 
    the section within you have created the article. You can alter this choice 
    at any time.</li>
  <li><b>Keywords</b>: Specify the words that will help search engines find your 
    article more easily. This field is optional and you can alter it at any stage.  
  </li>
</ul>
<P>After you fill out the required fields and make your article-display choices, 
  you should press the 'Save changes' button. You will have the option to either 
  edit the article you just created (press YES) or go back to the Articles view 
  (press NO). </P>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
  <tr> 
    <td>TIP: You may write the article name in any alphabet, but bear in mind 
      that if you are publishing a multilingual publication that includes two 
      non-Western European (i.e. that use code pages different than ISO-8859-1) 
      alphabets, say Hebrew and Russian, you will not be able to display article 
      names in both languages correctly at the same time in the article view. 
      This is because article name is a text-type field and it is affected by 
      the encoding that is currently active in your browser. Therefore you may 
      want to create a separate field for the actual title of the article while 
      filling the name fields with characters that belong to code pages that can 
      be correctly displayed together in the article list (e.g. ISO-8859-1 and 
      ISO-8859-2, or ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-5; in both cases you should select 
      the respective non-Western European encoding in your browser for viewing 
      article lists.</td>

</table>
<P>TECH NOTE: Name is the default field available for any article, no matter what 
  type of article is selected. This was created both for testing purposes and 
  for letting the webmaster define a default behavior of articles. For example, 
  if a template doesn't provide a handler for a specific article type, or you 
  don't know the list of fields of an article type, you can be sure that there 
  is a field called 'name'!</P>
<P>2.2.6 <b>Editing articles: Edit Article Details view<a name="2.2.6"></a></b></P>
<P>If you choose to edit your newly created article right away you will be led 
  to the Edit Article Details view. This is the main article-editing interface, 
  to which you will also get when you click on a name of any article in the Articles 
  view. This view shows how the article is stored in the database. Its look will 
  depend on the article type you have assigned to that article when you created 
  it. </P>
<P>The fields you will see regardless of the type of article you are viewing are:</P>
<ul>
  <li><b>Name</b>, containing the name you had given to the article when you created 
    it. This field is editable.</li>
  <li><b>Type</b>, informs you which article type you had chosen for your article. 
    You cannot alter this field </li>
  <li><b>Uploaded</b>, showing the date the article was edited for the first time. 
    You cannot change this field.</li>
  <li><b>Keywords</b>, where you can add or delete the words that describe your 
    article better to search engines. </li>
</ul>
<P>You will also see the two check boxes you saw when you created the article 
  (Show article on front page and Show article on section page, respectively), 
  plus another option: Allow users without subscriptions to view the article. 
  You should tick the latter if you want to make your article visible to viewers 
  who have not subscribed to your publication (see section <a href="#2.2.4">2.2.4</a>).</P>
<P>In addition to these system-determined fields and options, you may see any 
  number and combination of different fields that you had made when you created 
  a given article type.</P>
<P>As it was mentioned earlier in this manual (see section <a href="#2.2.4">2.2.4</a>), 
  there are three types of fields: Text, Date, and Body. </P>
<P>Usually there are several text-type fields, designed to contain shorter bits 
  of text, such as article titles, short descriptions, author names, etc. There 
  are rarely more than one date-type fields, which web designers normally use 
  to provide the journalists with an option to specify the date the article was 
  published (posted). </P>
<P>Both text- and date-type fields can be edited directly in the Edit Article 
  Details view.</P>

      way, you may get incorrect results.</font></b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>Body-type fields usually contain the bulk of an article's content (the main 
  narrative part of the text, bibliographies, author biographies etc.). To edit 
  them, you have to launch CAMPFIRE, CAMPSITE's Java editor. You can do so by 
  clicking on the 'Edit' button near the left corner of each body-type field. 
  You can edit one body-type field at a time.</P>
<P>Above the article structure, you will always see the following six buttons:</P>
<ul>
  <li><b>Submit/Publish/Unpublish</b> (depending on the copy-flow status of your 
    article)</li>
  <li><b>Images</b> - lets you upload images that can be used within body-type 
    fields of the article. </li>
  <li><b>Unlock</b>, which you can use to withdraw your reservation of the article 
    (e.g. when you are finished with your editing). The unlocking is in principle 
    done automatically, but since CAMPSITE is a server-based application accessed 
    through web browsers, a number of events (computer crashes, line falling, 
    etc.) could prevent this from happening. </li>
  <li><b>Preview</b>, which allows you to preview the article (see below for more 
    detail</li>
  <li><b>Translate</b>, which allows you to create a version of the article you 
    are editing in another language. </li>
  <li><b>Delete</b>, which is self-explanatory</li>
</ul>
<P>2.2.7 <b>Editing body-type fields: Working with CAMPFIRE<a name="2.2.7"></a></b></P>
<P>CAMPFIRE allows contributors (journalists or editors) without any technical 
  or HTML knowledge to perform extensive formatting procedures. </P>
<P>Chances are that anyone who has ever worked with a text editor should find 
  CAMPFIRE intuitive to use. CAMPFIRE features a toolbar with buttons from which 
  main functions can be performed, while additional features can be accessed from 
  pull-down menus. </P>
<P>All text-formatting features are fully WYSIWYG, except align justify. The non-WYSIWYG 
  features are insertion of images, links, subheads/page breaks and CAMPSITE Dictionary 
  keywords. </P>
<P>From left to right on the toolbar, in order of appearance, the buttons are:</P>
<ul>
  <li><b>New</b> - clears the editor; </li>
  <li><b>Select all</b>;</li>
  <li><b>Undo</b>, which allows you to undo multiple changes in the order you 
    made them;</li>
  <li><b>Redo</b>, which does exactly the opposite; </li>
  <li><b>Clipboard operations</b>, which opens an extra window displaying the 
    content of the clipboard and its standard functionality (this feature was 
    mainly implemented to provide cut and paste functions to Netscape users; see 
    section <a href="#1.2.5">1.2.5</a>);</li>
  <li><b>Italic</b></li>
  <li><b>Bold</b> </li>
  <li><b>Underline</b></li>
  <li><b>Align left</b></li>
  <li><b>Align center</b></li>
  <li><b>Align right</b></li>
  <li><b>Choose font color</b></li>
  <li><b>Clear attributes</b>, which will remove all formatting from the selected 
    area. </li>
  <li><b>Insert keyword</b>, will mark the selected word as Dictionary keyword 
    (for more on Dictionary and keywords, see section 2.3 of this manual). </li>
  <li><b>Insert subhead</b> allows subheads in your text to become page breaks. 
    This command inserts a code around the subhead you select, which the parser 
    will interpret as a page break and parse the subhead on a new page (N.B. This 
    feature has to be enabled in your templates; see Part 3 of this manual for 
    more details). </li>
  <li><b>Insert image</b> inserts an image placeholder into the text. When you 
    click on it, you are prompted to select one of the images you previously uploaded 
    for that particular article. You can also specify the alignment and alt text 
    (the text that shows up when you go over an image with a mouse within a browser).</li>
  <li><b>External link</b> allows you to create an absolute link in the text. 
    You do so by highlighting (selecting) the segment of the text that you would 
    like to link to a web page (URL) of your choice and clicking on the External 
    link button. This places green link markers on both sides of your selection; 
    when you click on either of them, you are prompted to provide the URL and 
    you can specify where you want the link to open (e.g. a new window).</li>
  <li><b>Internal link</b> allows you to create links to other articles that you 
    have already created within campsite. The actual procedure is analogous to 
    the one with external links.</li>
  <li><b>Save/Upload</b> does exactly that: it saves the changes by uploading 
    the file into the CAMPSITE database. If you close the window without saving, 
    you run the chance of losing your data (CAMPSITE will prompt you to save them 
    before you leave the window, but the best policy is to save your edits regularly).</li>
</ul>
<P>All of these functions are also available from the dropdown menus. The menus 
  feature three important extra options:</P>
<ul>
  <li><b>Font size</b>, which is self-explanatory </li>
  <li><b>Insert keyword</b>, which allows you to mark a word as a Dictionary keyword 
    (see section <a href="#2.3">2.3</a>)</li>
  <li><b>Justify all</b> (checkbox in the Other Options dropdown menu) - when 
    you check this box, the entire text within the editor becomes justified (see 
    NOTE 4 for more information). Unlike other kinds of alignment, this one does 
    not conform to the WYSIWYG standard and can only be seen in the Article Preview 
    (see section <a href="#2.2.7.1">2.2.7.1</a>).</li>
</ul>
<P><font color="#000099">NOTE 4: Current browsers do not treat consistently the 
  &lt;JUSTIFY&gt; option, and that is why We have chosen the HTML &lt;DIV&gt; 
  directive to implement that kind of alignment. Generally, one chose a certain 
  alignment for the whole page and then selects paragraphs with different alignments. 
  This is why this feature in the Editor's consists of a checkbox only, having 
  the meaning: align justified the whole document.</font></P>
<P>2.2.7.1 <b>The Preview function<a name="2.2.7.1"></a></b></P>
<P>Using CAMPFIRE, contributors can feed information into CAMPSITE's database. 
  However, the appearance of the article for the general audience will be different 
  than what you see as a contributor. The layout that readers will ultimately 
  see when they visit your web site is controlled by templates, which is described 
  in more detail in Part 3 of this manual.</P>
<P><font color="#000099">NOTE 5: the preview function only works once you saved 
  (uploaded) the text form the CAMPFIRE editor, because the preview will display 
  the most recent material in the database.</font></P>
<P>To use the preview function you need to have the templates created and properly 
  configured, as they are displaying the information from the database to the 
  audience, adding additional layout (navigation, banners, etc.) on the way. If 
  for example you have used CAMPFIRE to add information in the field 'biography', 
  but the template does not include the 'biography' in the final layout, the preview 
  function will not display this information.</P>
<P>2.2.7.2 <b>Previewing the publication<a name="2.2.7.2"></a></b></P>
<P>Once all articles are entered and the appropriate templates uploaded, you can 
  preview either the current issue or a single article. To preview the home page, 
  choose the home template and then preview. </P>
<P>The home page layout depends on a special stand-alone template that can be 
  changed independently. All changes to the template can be previewed as soon 
  as the template has been uploaded. </P>
<P>Individual articles can be previewed from the 'Articles' area. Simply click 
  'Preview' to open an extra window with the final page.</P>
<P><font color="#000099">NOTE 6: At the bottom of the preview window, you can 
  see information about the parser. If any problems occur while generating the 
  site, the CAMPSITE parser will display error messages. These should help you 
  to identify the problem in the template structure.</font></P>
<P>2.2.8 <b>Publishing articles<a name="2.2.8"></a></b></P>
<P>CAMPSITE's copy-flow control feature operates by means of assigning three statuses 
  to an article: new, submitted, and published. </P>
<P>When you create an article, it is set to 'New'. If you change the status to 
  'Submit', then - via email - the editors will be informed to check the new submission. 
  Editors will also be informed on new submissions when they login into CAMPSITE. 
  Once the editors are happy with the way the article reads and appears, they 
  can alter its status to 'Published'. Only then article becomes visible on your 
  web site (provided that you have previously published the relevant issue of 
  your publication). The whole process is fully reversible, so you can pull out 
  articles from your site as easily as you can publish them. </P>
<P><font color="#000099">NOTE 7: Only authorized users are allowed to publish 
  articles, so you may not be able to access that option if your administrator 
  has not granted you such rights.</font></P>
<P>2.2.9 <b>Setting the finalized publication live<a name="2.2.9"></a></b></P>
<P>All the above functions, such as adding articles, editing, previewing, can 
  be done internally, without any material being available to the public.</P>
<P>Once you decide that the time (or the deadline) has come to bring the new material 
  online, you need to change the status of the issue, by selecting the Publish 
  option from the Issues view. In addition, you can set that 'Public' flag on 
  or off for each and every particular article, hiding it if necessary even if 
  the issue is already published.</P>
<P>2.3. <b>Dictionary<a name="2.3."></a></b></P>
<P>The Dictionary module allows you to create and globally update short pieces 
  of additional information for specific words. For example, some background information 
  on a company or a person might be saved in the Dictionary. In any article where 
  this company or person is marked as a keyword, a link will be displayed, showing 
  additional information. To update this information, the editor only needs to 
  go into the dictionary and update the information there. All changes will happen 
  globally for the entire publication, including back issues.</P>
<P>Depending on the context within which these keywords appear, different types 
  of information can be saved separately. It might, for example, be interesting 
  to know more about the location of a company in one context, in another case 
  it might be crucial to know who is running it. To make such distinctions, the 
  Dictionary module features 'classes', which can be chosen to be displayed. For 
  example, I might decide to mark the name of a person in a political analysis 
  as a keyword. And in this particular context, I wish to have a description of 
  the political career as additional information (as opposed to the past three 
  marriages, which might be interesting in another context). So I need to enter 
  the person's name (e.g. Helmut Kohl) as a keyword in the Dictionary. Later, 
  when writing the article, I can mark Helmut Kohl as a keyword, and then assign 
  the appropriate class (e.g. 'private life' or 'political career') to that incidence 
  of 'Helmut Kohl' in the text.</P>
<P>To make use of the Dictionary function in your daily editing, you need to do 
  the following: </P>
<ul>
  <li>define keywords (e.g. Helmut Kohl)</li>
  <li>create classes (e.g. Love Life, Career, Hobbies) </li>
</ul>
<P>Once these steps have been taken you can mark keywords inside CAMPFIRE (the 
  Java Editor). Later, when displaying the article, the parser will search the 
  dictionary database for related entries. If such an entry is found, the parser 
  will include a link, allowing the reader to access the additional explanation. 
  If no such entry is found, the word is displayed regularly. </P>
<P>Changes to the dictionary can happen at any time and will be dynamically included 
  in the display. The marked keyword will always trigger the parser to search 
  through the current version of the dictionary and display the most up to date 
  information.</P>
<P>2.3.1 <b>Creating 'dictionary classes'<a name="2.3.1"></a></b></P>
<P>From the Home view, select 'Dictionary Classes' where you can add new classes. 
  Here you can also translate the classes into any of the languages defined in 
  CAMPSITE (see section <a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>).</P>
<P>2.3.2 <b>Adding keywords to the dictionary<a name="2.3.2"></a></b></P>
<P>Choose Dictionary from the navigation bar on the left, then select 'Add new 
  keyword'. You will be prompted to type the keyword and specify the language. 
  When finished, the keyword will appear in the list of keywords. Now you have 
  to assign a class to the keyword. Choose 'Classes' in the same line as the keyword 
  to see all available classes. Mark the one you want to associate the keyword 
  with and click 'Done'. You can repeat this process to associate the keyword 
  with more than one class. </P>
<P>You can also translate the keyword into other languages. This will generate 
  a new keyword in the listing, using the same classes.</P>
<P>2.3.3 <b>Marking keywords in the articles<a name="2.3.3"></a></b></P>
<P>When writing or editing material in the CAMPFIRE editor, you select the word 
  you want to make a keyword, choose 'Insert' from the pull-down menu and 'Create 
  Keyword'. This will open a window, asking you to choose a class to be associated 
  with the keyword. </P>
<P>The marked keyword will not necessarily become an active link in the article. 
  This will only happen if the same word has been defined as a keyword, as described 
  above. Only then the parser will find the word in the keyword list and build 
  the link, opening the pop-up window with further information.</P>
<P>2.3.4 <b>What pays the piper, will see the surfer<a name="2.3.4"></a></b></P>
<P>As the parser is going through the text, it will firstly find the marked keyword, 
  then check in the dictionary if such a word has been defined. If this is the 
  case, the parser will generate a link, opening a popup window, displaying the 
  information of the class of the keyword marked. The other classes are also offered 
  as further reading. </P>
<P>If the parser detects a keyword, but can not find the same word in the dictionary 
  entry, no link will appear. However, once this keyword is added to the dictionary, 
  the parser will generate a link. Marked keywords are like sleeping beauties.  
</P>
<P>2.3.5 <b>Known Limitations of the Dictionary Module<a name="2.3.5"></a></b></P>
<P>In its present incarnation (CAMPSITE version 2.x.x), the Dictionary module 
  is functional, but its appearance is still, shall we say, rather sobering. We 
  thus consider it as a feature under development, particularly regarding the 
  lack of possibility for CAMPSITE administrators to alter the layout of the popup 
  windows. In other words, you can use it, but you might want to see if the appearance 
  of the pop-up window would not strongly conflict with your overall design. If 
  you decide to continue the dictionary development, please inform us, so we can 
  announce this on our support list.</P>
<P>2.4. <b>Configuring the Subscription Module<a name="2.4."></a></b></P>
<P>CAMPSITE allows you to control access to your site in two ways: </P>
<ul>
  <li>Standard UserName:Password pairs, which is suitable for individual users;</li>
  <li>IP Address access, which most institutional subscribers (libraries, universities, 
    NGOs, companies, etc.) tend to prefer</li>
</ul>
<P>As CAMPSITE handles subscriptions at publication level, all subscription-related 
  variables are customizable from the Publications view. Columns 'Subscription 
  default time' and 'Info' are relevant in this context.</P>
<P>The 'Subscription default time' parameter allows you to set default trial-subscription 
  duration (Trial time) and the default duration of paid subscription (Paid time) 
  for individual countries. To do so, click on Change in the 'Subscription default 
  time' column. You will then have the option to Add new country, i.e. create 
  subscription preferences for a given country. </P>
<P>If you click on Change in the 'Info' column, you will be able to specify the 
  remainder of subscription parameters for your publication: </P>
<ul>
  <li>Pay Time - specifies the time within which the user has to pay for his subscription 
    (in the meantime, he has immediate access to the site); </li>
  <li>Time-unit - specifies the time unit you would like to use to measure the 
    duration of subscriptions; you can select day, week, month, or year;</li>
  <li>Unit cost - the price for a section for the selected time unit; </li>
  <li>Currency - the publication's currency. Even if the subscription request 
    is sent and the currency is changed meanwhile, the information about the user's 
    debt is correctly recorded. </li>
</ul>
<P>2.4.1 <b>Username:Password Access<a name="2.4.1"></a></b></P>
<P>CAMPSITE allows readers to subscribe to one publication at a time. Within a 
  publication itself, the level of subscription is the section. The reader is 
  able to select any section from the list of the publication's sections, and 
  for each of them specify the period of time he would like to have a subscription 
  for. </P>
<P>Before submitting his request, the user (reader) can evaluate the cost of the 
  subscription and change it. At any time later, he can subscribe to additional 
  sections. Once the user has subscribed to a section, he can't increase the period 
  of time for the subscription until payment is done for that section. </P>
<P>Immediately after the completion of the subscription form, the reader has the 
  right to view the site. By default, the reader has seven days to make a payment 
  and have his subscription confirmed by the administrator or else the account 
  is locked. </P>
<P>The authorized person can confirm the payment, so that the subscription remains 
  active after the first 7 days. There are two options in the administration module 
  for that: change the value of the amount that the subscriber has to pay, or 
  change the number of days the subscriber is allowed to surf the publication's 
  site. By default, if this sum is set to 0 (zero), the number of paid days is 
  automatically set to the number of requested days.</P>
<P>The administrator (or any other user whose profile allows him to manage publications) 
  has 7 days to confirm the payment. The confirmation is made from the main menu, 
  by selecting User and then Subscriptions. The confirmation consists in changing 
  the payment status (from 'no' to 'yes'). </P>
<P>2.4.2 <b>Customizing Subscription Interface for Readers<a name="2.4.2"></a></b></P>
<P>The subscription interface for the user is customizable. Depending on the user's 
  status, several steps must be taken by a user in order to be able to read the 
  publication. There are three possible scenarios:</P>
<ul>
  <li>the user has never subscribed; the user is served a subscription form (name, 
    login, password, email etc); after the completion of this form, the user can 
    start subscribing to any section</li>
  <li>the user has already subscribed (i.e. is a known user to the system) but 
    only to a few sections, and he wants to add more sections to the subscriptions 
    he has already made, which might have expired; the user should be served a 
    different subscription form (reflecting his status of a known user) </li>
  <li>the user is not known to the system even though his subscriptions are active 
    (e.g. the subscriber hasn't logged for a long time, even if his subscriptions 
    are active; a login form must be supplied for such a user.</li>
</ul>
<P>Template designer can customize all those forms by means of CAMPSITE's description 
  language (see Part 3 of this manual). </P>
<P>2.4.3 <b>IP Address-based Subscriptions<a name="2.4.3"></a></b></P>
<P>Subscriptions can also be created through the administration interface. This 
  is normally done for two purposes: </P>
<P>First, an administrator needs to be able to emulate the experience of a regular 
  user in order to test the functionality. So he must be able to create a user 
  identities with reading rights only. </P>
<P>Second, IP address-based subscription has to be fully controlled by the administrator, 
  as a reader could possibly grant access for 7 days for the whole Internet. </P>
<P>To create an IP address-based subscription, the administrator first creates 
  a regular UserId:Password account, to which then he adds IP based rights. The 
  double authorization option was implemented because the administrator can't 
  test the subscription from his computer if only the IP address-based authentication 
  is active. He must enter in a different way (UserId:Password) and rights must 
  be assigned as if he were coming from an appropriate IP address. It is not necessary 
  to add anything to the templates or to inform the users who will be accessing 
  the site through IP address authentication of the existence of this UserId:Password 
  pair.</P>
<P>3. <b>CREATING TEMPLATES FOR YOUR PUBLICATION<a name="3."></a></b></P>
<P>When implementing CAMPSITE, chances are you will already have a rather clear 
  outline of the structure of your publication online, or - even better - have 
  a running web version already in HTML. Either way, to migrate your publication 
  to CAMPSITE, you will have to generate customized templates for your content. 
  Such templates will be incorporating the CAMPSITE tags used to pull information 
  from the database into the HTML page readable by web browsers.</P>
<P>The following sections will guide you step by step through the process of generating 
  such templates. Before proceeding (step 0 if you like) would be the actual planning 
  and layout work of your web site. This can be done with any HTML editor of your 
  choice. However, the following will cover the transformation of an existing 
  HTML design into templates and NOT web design itself... this ain't no web design 
  lecture.</P>
<P>One of the main goals of CAMPSITE is to offer a fully customizable layout for 
  online publications and at the same time keep the content independent of the 
  layout. This is done by means of templates. Those templates are nothing more 
  than HTML files containing embedded CAMPSITE description-language tags, which 
  creates the link between the view and the content.</P>
<P>3.1. <b>Modular Structure of Templates<a name="3.1."></a></b></P>
<P>A glance at all articles of an online publication reveals that generally there 
  are many layout similarities even across different sections of the publication. 
  Taking advantage of such similarities is what the template structure of CAMPSITE 
  was meant to do. In other words: design features that remain the same for all 
  articles only need to be specified once, e.g. the navigation from an article 
  back to section and home, font type and size, background color and the like.  
</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are article components that vary between articles. 
  For example, the top of the article might contain some specific logo to indicate 
  which section it belongs to. In such a case, the templates are designed to work 
  in a modular fashion, allowing you to call up templates within templates.</P>
<P>The modular structure of the templates can be illustrated well by the following 
  example: If background color, font size and type are the same for all articles, 
  they will be specified as plain HTML in the template. But differences between 
  sections will be indicated within the structure of the template (see below) 
  indicating "if this article belongs to the politics section, insert such-and-such 
  template here, if it is sports, insert such-and-such, else: just use the following."  
</P>
<P>Templates can be stacked within each other. A template can be made to call 
  another template and include the layout information at the position where it 
  was called in the main template. The easiest way to illustrate this modular 
  structure is by looking at a usual tree structure of folders on a computer. 
  Starting from general categories, the deeper the structure, the more precise 
  and specific the folder names and information.</P>
<P>The modular structure was introduced to keep redundancy to zero and therefore 
  the layout work minimal. Any design changes need to be made only once in the 
  templates, never even twice, if you make full use of this modularity potential.  
</P>
<P>3.2. <b>Fixed Framework: Communicating with Your Database<a name="3.2."></a></b></P>
<P>Templates are in-between your content database and your audience on the web. 
  Therefore they need to mediate between both. The database needs to understand 
  what information is requested, and the user's browser needs to retrieve a finished 
  HTML page. </P>
<P>The template sets the stage, passing specific environmental information to 
  the database query, such as: "list only articles from current issue and section 
  'sports'." At the same time, it gives detailed instructions on how content should 
  be displayed in HTML format. This distinction between environment and content 
  is crucial for understanding and building templates. The template language was 
  designed to be usable on different levels of dynamic features: one can make 
  static templates for every issue, section, article or just a few customized 
  templates that generate different views depending on the given parameters.</P>
<P>The following will cover some examples on how to build templates. Further down 
  you can find a complete list of available commands used by CAMPSITE templates.</P>
<P>3.3. <b>Building an article template: articletemplate.tpl<a name="3.3."></a></b></P>
<P>Building an article template is the easiest option. All you need to do is generate 
  your HTML layout and substitute the dynamic sections (title, author, intro, 
  text...) with the simple tag:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** print article title&gt;</font></P>
<P>The command is 'print article'; the 'title' part varies. This is the name of 
  the variable that you assigned when building the Article Types. So it could 
  also read:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** print article sportsitemdeck&gt;</font></P>
<P>As the rest of the HTML layout remains as it is, a simple template might look 
  like this:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;html&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;!** print 
  article title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
  &lt;body&gt;<br>
  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;!** print article title&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
  &lt;h3&gt;&lt;!** print article subtitle&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
  &lt;i&gt;Written by &lt;!** print article authorname&gt; on the &lt;!**print 
  article date&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** print article text&gt;<br>
  &lt;/body&gt;<br>
  &lt;/html&gt;</font></P>
<P>The reason we can reduce the templates to such a simple solution is, because 
  CAMPSITE will remember where it comes from and where it is. So by the time the 
  user arrives at one particular article, CAMPSITE knows the publication, the 
  issue, the section, and even the article ID and can simply generate the HTML 
  page from the database by using the environmental variables together with the 
  layout information in the template.</P>
<P>Obviously, your design can be far more advanced than this page. And CAMPSITE 
  can also perform far more advanced functions than this. In order to get a feel 
  for this, let's jump into the next example, building the navigation. (A full 
  list of tag commands can be found at the end of this chapter.)</P>
<P>3.4. <b>Generating a Navigation Template: navigationtemplate.tpl<a name="3.4."></a></b></P>
<P>As described above, the template structure can be nested, meaning one template 
  can call another template. This, for example, makes a lot of sense for the navigation. 
  To jump between sections, you might only need one navigation template that can 
  be used by all other templates (article, section, home page). </P>
<P>To nest another template within another, use the following CAMPSITE tag:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** include navigationtemplate.tpl&gt;</font></P>
<P>The 'include' command is CAMPSITE lingo; the name of the template needs to 
  be adjusted to whatever you called it. Let's assume we add this tag in the article 
  template we created earlier, and we can now go on and build the template.</P>
<P>First thing to do when you are building something like the navigation is to 
  take control over the environmental variables. Our navigation needs to follow 
  some standard rules and should not be affected too much by the environmental 
  setting of the current position of the user. </P>
<P>In terms of CAMPSITE lingo, we need to introduce a 'local' tag, which allows 
  us to specify some environmental variables for a local section inside the template. 
  In other words, we can switch off the environmental variables, set our own and 
  then switch them on again. In that way we can use the same template for the 
  navigation for all articles, sections, even issues (not publications, obviously).  
</P>
<P>In order to make sure you enter the current issue in the navigation bar, set 
  the environment variables to:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** local&gt;&lt;!** issue current&gt;</font></P>
<P>Here, 'local' allows you to set the parameters inside a template to the values 
  you want to be specified. Once the parser finds the 'endlocal' tag, it will 
  switch back to the environment variables it arrived with (for example a back 
  issue).</P>
<P>Then the issue parameter is set to 'current'. This is done in order to make 
  sure that the navigation will always jump to the 'section' (or whatever you 
  want) of the current issue. </P>
<P>Then you would need to specify which section you would want to link to. This 
  is done with the 'section number' tag.</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** section number 1&gt;</font></P>
<P>The above tag would set the local section parameter to 1, which will be looked 
  up in the CAMPSITE database under section entries (each section is assigned 
  a number when it is created, see section <a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a> of this 
  manual).</P>
<P>Now we have set all necessary values for the link: we will link to section 
  1 in the current issue. All we need to do now is create the link to the section, 
  or - to be more precise - the template that is used to build section pages.</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?&lt;!** 
  urlparameters&gt;"&gt;NEWS&lt;/a&gt;</font></P>
<P>This will create an ordinary link, using the anchor tag of HTML. This link 
  will call the sectiontemplate.tpl (you need to substitute sectiontemplate.tpl 
  with your template name). In our example, all templates are in the same folder. 
  If they are in a different folder, you can use a relative link (e.g. look/reporter/logo.gif).</P>
<P>Then we need to pass the parameters to the template, which allows the parser 
  to fill the page with content from the database. So the template is followed 
  by '?' (indicating that other variables are following) and then the CAMPSITE 
  tag 'urlparameters' will include all the information (such as language, publication, 
  etc.) but using the local settings we adjusted earlier (current issue and section 
  1). Finally, we need to end the local parameters with the tag:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** endlocal&gt;</font></P>
<P>A complete navigation template could look like this:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** local&gt;&lt;!** issue current&gt;&lt;!** 
  section number 1&gt;<br>
  &lt;a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?&lt;!** urlparameters&gt;"&gt;NEWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlocal&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** local&gt;&lt;!** issue current&gt;&lt;!** section number 2&gt;<br>
  &lt;a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?&lt;!** urlparameters&gt;"&gt;POLITICS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlocal&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** local&gt;&lt;!** issue current&gt;&lt;!** section number 3&gt;<br>
  &lt;a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?&lt;!** urlparameters&gt;"&gt;SPORT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlocal&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** local&gt;&lt;!** issue current&gt;&lt;!** section number 4&gt;<br>
  &lt;a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?&lt;!** urlparameters&gt;"&gt;CULTURE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlocal&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** local&gt;&lt;!** issue current&gt;&lt;!** section number 5&gt;<br>
  &lt;a href="sectiontemplate.tpl?&lt;!** urlparameters&gt;"&gt;WEATHER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlocal&gt;</font></P>
<P>Make sure that the section numbers assigned correlate with the names of the 
  sections, as you assigned them when building the publication in the first place.</P>
<P>Now we can advance into a more conditional environment, the section pages.</P>
<P>3.5. <b>Building the Section Template: sectiontemplate.tpl<a name="3.5."></a></b></P>
<P>The main function of the section page is to provide a table of content for 
  all articles in a section. Each section needs to have its own sectiontemplate.tpl 
  specified. However, you can use one general section template, which will then 
  call different sub-templates, depending on the environmental variables as described 
  above. For example, you can have a different navigations for the sports and 
  the politics sections.</P>
<P>As mentioned before, the main aim of the sectiontemplate.tpl is the listing 
  of all articles in this section, for this issue (and this publication). A very 
  simple list could look like this:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** list article&gt;<br>
  &lt;a href="articletemplate.tpl?&lt;!** urlparameters&gt;"&gt;&lt;!** print 
  article name&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlist&gt;</font></P>
<P>This will list all articles in the section. Remember that CAMPSITE will pass 
  on its own environment variables, such as 'publication' and 'issue', to each 
  template. The 'list article' command already knows what section to list. The 
  second line will create the link, using the name of the article. </P>
<P>Here you can add more information, using the 'print article' command. If you 
  say:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;font size=-1&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;!** 
  print article deck&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</font></P>
<P>... this will include the 'deck' component (field) of the article, in a smaller 
  font and italics. All HTML remains just the way you always use it. Finally, 
  a line (horizontal rule) is drawn underneath the deck.</P>
<P>To close the listing, use the 'endlist' tag.</P>
<P>This example will order the articles in no particular way. If you want to make 
  sure the newest article is on the top of the list, you need to tell CAMPSITE 
  to order the listing:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** list article order bynumber 
  desc&gt;</font></P>
<P>3.5.1 <b>The 'Feature' article of the section<a name="3.5.1"></a></b></P>
<P>Most likely, one or more articles are the main (feature) articles in each section. 
  (Editors mark those articles as such by ticking the Show on section page box 
  in Edit Article Details view; for more details see section 2.2.6) What we will 
  do now, is build a listing for the section template, which will display the 
  feature articles (marked with 'show on section page') first and then list the 
  remaining articles.</P>
<P>&lt;!** list article ison section order bynumber desc&gt;</P>
<P>This will make sure that the only articles that will be used which have this 
  feature switched on. They are also ordered by descending numbers, with the newest 
  appearing on the top. This is followed by the variables you want to have listed 
  and the HTML formatting used. In our example it may look like this:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;a href="articletemplate.tpl?&lt;!** 
  urlparameters&gt;"&gt;&lt;!** print article name&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</font></P>
<P>We can then add more information from the database with the 'print article' 
  command. HTML code goes in-between.</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** end list&gt;</font></P>
<P>Then we need to end the listing with the 'end list' command. So here we will 
  list all the ones which are marked. But what if the editors checked more than 
  one article, but your design only works with ONE article on the top, not all 
  of them? </P>
<P>3.5.2 <b>Displaying only the most recent feature article on a section page<a name="3.5.2"></a></b></P>
<P>To use just the most recent article from the 'feature' articles in the section, 
  use the following tag:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** list length 1 article ison 
  section order bynumber desc&gt;<br>
  &lt;a href="articletemplate.tpl?&lt;!** urlparameters&gt;"&gt;&lt;!** print 
  article name&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** end list&gt;</font></P>
<P>This will create a list of articles (in our case only one, as the length is 
  set to 1) of the articles marked as 'show on section'. The list will be ordered 
  by descending numbers, the highest entry being featured on the top. As set in 
  this example, this will result in only the most recent entry of "feature" articles 
  within the section being shown.</P>
<P>A link is then created, containing the name of the article (which is the title).</P>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
  <tr> 
    <td><b><font color="#CC0000">WARNING: If you have built your list in the way 
      described above, only the first article is included. Imagine you have three 
      or four articles checked to 'show on section page', all but the most recent 
      one will be swallowed. This might make sense in some cases, but it might 
      be problematic for other designs.</font></b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>It might be better to make sure that we are printing the most recent marked 
  one, then the other marked ones and finally the normal articles in the section. 
  So we will keep the first command for our feature article in the section. Then 
  we need to make a list of all articles that are also checked to be 'on section 
  page'. But we need to exclude article number one.</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;** list article ison section order 
  bynumber desc&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** if list index 1&gt;&lt;!** else&gt;<br>
  ...<br>
  &lt;!** endif&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlist&gt;</font></P>
<P>This will build the list of all checked articles in the section. It will then 
  look at the index of each article, once it has ordered them. So the newest article 
  will have the index number one. The if condition will find this article and 
  do nothing - because - it runs straight into the 'else' area. Above, where you 
  can see the three dots, you can add your own listing, using the normal 'print 
  article' tag and your HTML code.</P>
<P>Finally, all we need to do is list the remaining articles. That's an easy task--simply 
  exclude the marked ones and list the rest. There you go:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;** list article isnoton section 
  order bynumber desc&gt;<br>
  ...<br>
  &lt;!** endlist&gt;</font></P>
<P>Again, include your HTML with the other variables in-between.</P>
<P>3.5.3 <b>Including Images in the Section Listing<a name="3.5.3"></a></b></P>
<P>As seen above, the sectiontemplate.tpl will always pull information out of 
  the database and display it in a list format. If we have images included in 
  the article, they will appear on the article page, but how can we display an 
  individual, small image for one article in the section listing?</P>
<P>The answer is quite simple. Create a body field in your Article Type that will 
  only contain the image that goes into the section listing. Let's say we call 
  this variable 'sectionimage'. Then all you need to add in the section listing 
  to display the image is:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** print article sectionimage&gt;</font></P>
<P>This will then generate the HTML code as saved in the database. And in our 
  case that means it will create the image tag including the image. You could 
  even generate a little subtitle for the image in this field when entering the 
  article text and images.</P>
<P>3.6. <b>Building the home page template: home.tpl<a name="3.6."></a></b></P>
<P>...is more or less the same, just needs some more practice, so this is your 
  chance to practice...</P>
<P>3.7. <b>Some hints: powerful lists and ordering<a name="3.7."></a></b></P>
<P>Listing and ordering are two powerful functions in CAMPSITE lingo. In the following 
  example we would like to automate an update for the sections 3, 4 and 5. Whenever 
  an editor posts some new articles in either of these sections and publishes 
  them, we want the home page to display a link to the newest article in the center 
  column. Also, we want the second newest posting to be listed in the left column.</P>
<P>In order to achieve this, our home page template needs to select sections 3, 
  4 and 5, then order them from newest to oldest and take the top entry for the 
  center and the second one for the left column.</P>
<P>What do we need to do?</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** list length 3 section number 
  greater 2&gt;</font></P>
<P>This will select the sections 3, 4, and 5.</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** list length 1 article order 
  bynumber desc&gt;</font></P>
<P>This line orders the entries from newest to oldest and only returns the newest 
  article, because the length of the list is set to one. </P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** print section name&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** print article title&gt;</font></P>
<P>...to print the most recent for each section.</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** endlist&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlist&gt;</font></P>
<P>... to close the list again.</P>
<P>So, now we need to take the second articles for each section to go into the 
  column on the left. This can be done similar to the example above:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** list length 3 section number 
  greater 2&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** list length 2 article order bynumber desc&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** if list index 1&gt;&lt;!** else&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** print section name&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** print article title&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlist&gt;<br>
  &lt;!** endlist&gt;</font></P>
<P>3.8. <b>Environmental control with CAMPSITE templates<a name="3.8."></a></b></P>
<P>Instructions within CAMPSITE lingo fall into two categories: those that do 
  not generate output but only select the environment for the rest of the instructions, 
  and those that print a certain information from the database according to the 
  environment set by the first type of instructions.</P>
<P>3.8.1 <b>Runtime given parameters<a name="3.8.1"></a></b></P>
<P>The information selected also depends on the runtime given parameters. These 
  parameters are:</P>
<ul>
  <li>language identifier (IdLang) which sets the current language</li>
  <li>publication identifier (IdPubl) which sets the current publication</li>
  <li>issue number (NrIssue) which sets the current issue</li>
  <li>section number (NrSection) which sets the current section</li>
  <li>article number (NrArticle) which sets the article</li>
</ul>
<P>3.8.2 <b>Other parameters<a name="3.8.2"></a></b></P>
<P>and also some special parameters:</P>
<ul>
  <li>the keywords parameter, which specifies that keywords will be used as filters 
    in a List SearchResult statement; it is used for the local search engine</li>
  <li>a list index start, that specifies the starting index for a each type of 
    list: Issue (ILStart), Section (SLStart), Article (ALStart), Article search 
    (SRLstart)</li>
</ul>
<P>All runtime parameters form the so-called "data context" within which each 
  article is positioned.</P>
<P>3.9. <b>Structure of CAMPSITE templates<a name="3.9."></a></b></P>
<P>The structure of the CAMPSITE templates is simple. It is a continuous row of
  either HTML language or the commands used by CAMPSITE to pull content out of
  the database. Any template in its most simplified form looks like this:</P>
<P><i>[HTML text] [CAMPSITE Instruction] [HTML text ] [CAMPSITE Instruction] ....</i></P>
<P>The following example is an HTML beginning of a CAMPSITE template. In general,
  the best way to go about making templates is to finish the HTML layout work,
  then identify the chunks that do not need any changes and insert CAMPSITE tags
  in-between to customize the layout. </P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;template
  1&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</font></P>
<P>This template does not contain CAMPSITE Instructions. Taking this example a
  little bit further, the above example could be asked to display the day of the
  month.</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;!** Date
  mday&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</font></P>
<P>This template is made of:</P>
<P>HTML text: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
  </font></P>
<P>CAMPSITE Instruction: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!** Date
  mday&gt; </font></P>
<P>HTML text: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</font></P>
<P>...and will print the day of the month (numeric) for the current date. You
  can see the most important format standard that will follow all work through
  the pages to come, the CAMPSITE tag. Requests to CAMPSITE to replace a part
  of the template with information from the database is always inside the &lt;!**
  &gt; tag. </P>
<P>Template 3:</P>
<P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br>

<P>...and will print the names of articles that are on the front page, no matter
  if they are protected or not by the subscription system.</P>
<P>Beware that depending on the given runtime parameters this template will print
  different information. For example, if only NrIssue parameter is specified,
  this template will select all articles to be shown on the front page, for the
  given issue number, for all publications.</P>

<P>5. <b>APPENDIX II - CHARACTER SETS AND LANGUAGES<a name="5."></a></b></P>
<P>Covering non-ASCII character sets requires standards to make such special characters 
  cross-platform compatible. Some standards have been set over the past years 
  and are already implemented in most browsers. These are:</P>
<P>Code Page&#9;Character Set</P>
<ul>
  <li>ISO-8859-1&#9;Latin 1 I</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-2&#9;Latin 2</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-3&#9;Latin 3</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-4&#9;Baltic</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-5&#9;Cyrillic</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-6&#9;Arabic</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-7&#9;Greek</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-8&#9;Hebrew</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-9&#9;Turkish</li>
  <li>ISO-8859-15&#9;Latin 9 </li>
</ul>
<P>Multilingual support has been developed in various projects, independently 
  from each other, resulting in some confusion and a lack of consistent standards. 
  Recently those efforts have been channeled into a new universal standard called 
  Unicode. Unicode tries to encapsulate all previously defined character sets, 
  expanding the bytes used to represent each character. For more information on 
  the Unicode project, see the official web site: http://www.unicode.org/</P>
<P>Because different vendors had already created different versions of Unicode 
  characters, we have endowed CAMPSITE with a generic translation table so that 
  characters represented with one byte can be seen within this application without 
  any special configurations on the client side.</P>
<P>IMPORTANT: The configuration of your local machine must be set for multilingual 
  support. </P>
<P>Below you can find the best matches for individual languages and the appropriate 
  character sets:</P>
<P>Latin1 covers most West European languages, such as French (fr), Spanish (es), 
  Catalan (ca), Basque (eu), Portuguese (pt), Italian (it), Albanian (sq), Rhaeto-Romanic 
  (rm), Dutch (nl), German (de), Danish (da), Swedish (sv), Norwegian (no), Finnish 
  (fi), Faroese (fo), Icelandic (is), Irish (ga), Scottish (gd), and English (en), 
  incidentally also Afrikaans (af) and Swahili (sw), thus in effect also the entire 
  American continent, Australia and much of Africa. The most notable exceptions 
  are Zulu (zu) and other Bantu languages using Latin Extended-B letters, and 
  of course Arabic in North Africa, and Guarani (gn) missing GEIUY with ~ tilde. 
  The lack of the ligatures Dutch IJ, French OE and ,,German` quotation marks 
  is considered tolerable. The lack of the new C=-resembling Euro currency symbol 
  U+20AC has opened the discussion of a new Latin0. </P>
<P>Latin1 has also been adopted as the first page of ISO 10646 (Unicode).</P>
<P>Latin1 is HTML's base charset but HTML has now been globalized through RFC 
  2070.</P>
<P>Latin2 covers the languages of Central and Eastern Europe: Czech (cs), Hungarian 
  (hu), Polish (pl), Romanian (ro), Croatian (hr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), 
  Sorbian. For Romanian the S and T had better use commas instead of cedilla as 
  in Turkish: the U+015F LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH CEDILLA at =BA ought to be 
  read as U+0219 LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH COMMA BELOW etc. The German Umlaute 
  &auml;&ouml;&uuml;&szlig; are found at exactly the same positions in Latin1, 
  Latin2, Latin3, Latin4, Latin5, Latin6. Thus you can write German and Polish 
  with Latin2 or German and Turkish with Latin5 but there is no 8bit charset to 
  properly mix German and Russian, for instance. </P>
<P>Latin3 is popular with authors of Esperanto (eo) and Maltese (mt), and it covered 
  Turkish before the introduction of Latin5 in 1988. </P>
<P>Latin4 introduced letters for Estonian (et), the Baltic languages Latvian (lv, 
  Lettish) and Lithuanian (lt), Greenlandic (kl) and Lappish. Note that Latvian 
  requires the cedilla on the =BB U+0123 LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH CEDILLA to 
  jump on top. Latin4 was followed by Latin6. </P>
<P>Latin5: With these Cyrillic letters you can type Bulgarian (bg), Belarusian 
  (be), Macedonian (mk), Russian (ru), Serbian (sr) and pre-1990 (no ghe with 
  upturn) Ukrainian (uk). The ordering is based on the (incompatibly) revised 
  GOST 19768 of 1987 with the Russian letters except for &euml; sorted by Russian 
  alphabet (ABVGDE). Some still prefer to use in their applications the Ukrainian 
  character set, KOI8-U.</P>
<P>Latin6: This is the Arabic alphabet. Unfortunately the basic alphabet for Arabic 
  (ar) does not containing the four extra letters for Persian (fa) nor the eight 
  extra letters for Pakistani Urdu (ur). This fixed font is not well-suited for 
  text display. Each Arabic letter occurs in up to four (2) presentation forms: 
  initial, medial, final or separate. To make Arabic text legible you'll need 
  a display engine that analyses the context and combines the appropriate glyphs 
  on top of a handler for the reverse writing direction shared with Hebrew. Introduced 
  in 1992, Latin6 rearranged the Latin4 characters, dropped some symbols and the 
  Latvian &amp;rcedil;, added the last missing Inuit (Greenlandic Eskimo) and 
  non-Skolt Sami (Lappish) letters and reintroduced the Icelandic &eth;&yacute;&thorn; 
  to cover the entire Nordic area. Skolt Sami still needs a few more accents. 
  Note that RFC 1345 and GNU recode contain errors and use a preliminary and different 
  latin6.</P>
