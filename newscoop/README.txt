INTRODUCTION

Newscoop is a robust, stable, and journalist-friendly solution for
online magazines and newspapers that speaks your language.

Newscoop follows the print-newspaper publishing paradigm, so it
structures sites by default as Publications > Issues > Sections >
Articles.

Newscoop is available in: Arabic, Belarusian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech,
Dutch, English, German, Korean, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
Serbian (Cyrillic), Serbo-Croatian (Latin), Spanish, and Swedish.
However, the interface can easily be localized to new languages using
its built-in 'Localizer'.

With Newscoop you can:

   1. Manage articles translated into different languages
   2. Edit articles using an advanced WYSIWYG interface
   3. You can create your own definition of what an article is.
      For example, one article type might consist of "Intro",
      "Body", and "References", while another type might be
      "Body" and "Author Bio".
   4. Incorporate images into your articles
   5. Attach files to articles
   6. Allow site visitors to comment on your articles
   7. Categorize your articles with topics
   8. Schedule articles for release in the future
   9. Require a copy-flow process to ensure quality of content: the
      journalist writes the article, the editor reviews and edits
      the content, and then the article is published.
  10. Have full control over the look of your web site
  11. Exercise fine-grained access control for different types of staff
      users, for example: journalist, editor, designer, etc.
  12. Manage subscribers and allow:
         1. time trials
         2. pay periods
         3. IP access control for group subscriptions
  13. Localize the administration interface to new languages
  14. Build third-party plugins using the PHP object-oriented API

We encourage further development of this software and would like to
make any progress accessible to all other users. Please contact us
