1. General information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   All messages and subjects for the mail messages are defined as language
   strings in the language-files. So to customize mail messages, you can
   change the definition of these strings.

   For some mail messages, you can use a couple of special tags in the
   message and mailsubject, which are automatically replaced by relevant
   data.

   Below you'll find a list of the language strings that you can update for
   each type of mail message and the special tags that you can use in them.
